Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger ( ) , which is a computerized database ( ) using strong cryptography ( ) to secure transaction ( ) records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. [1] ( #cite_note-crypto_currency-1 ) [2] ( #cite_note-reuterspricing-2 ) [3] ( #cite_note-3 ) Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying categorical treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. [4] ( #cite_note-4 ) [5] ( #cite_note-5 ) [6] ( #cite_note-6 ) Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms. [7] ( #cite_note-proof-stake-eth-7 )
Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control ( ) as opposed to a central bank digital currency ( ) (CBDC). [8] ( #cite_note-8 ) When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger ( ) technology, typically a blockchain ( ) , that serves as a public financial transaction database. [9] ( #cite_note-9 )
A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology that only exists online. Cryptocurrencies use encryption to authenticate and protect transactions, hence their name. There are currently over a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world, and their supporters see them as the key to a fairer future economy. [10] ( #cite_note-10 ) [ failed verification ( ) ]
Bitcoin ( ) , first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. [11] ( #cite_note-11 ) Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies ( ) have been created.
In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum ( ) conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money ( ) called ecash ( ). [12] ( #cite_note-12 ) [13] ( #cite_note-13 ) Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash ( ) , [14] ( #cite_note-14 ) an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.
In 1996, the National Security Agency ( ) published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash , describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list [15] ( #cite_note-15 ) and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4). [16] ( #cite_note-16 )
In 1998, Wei Dai ( ) published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. [17] ( #cite_note-17 ) Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo ( ) described bit gold ( ). [18] ( #cite_note-18 ) Like bitcoin ( ) and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work ( ) function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.
In 2009, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto ( ). It used SHA-256 ( ) , a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work ( ) scheme. [19] ( #cite_note-primer-19 ) [20] ( #cite_note-20 ) In April 2011, Namecoin ( ) was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS ( ) , which would make internet censorship ( ) very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin ( ) was released. It used scrypt ( ) as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin ( ) , used a proof-of-stake ( ) hybrid. [21] ( #cite_note-ars1-21 )
On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury ( ) had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they could play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered. [22] ( #cite_note-Crypto_currencyUK-22 ) Its final report was published in 2018, [23] ( #cite_note-23 ) and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins ( ) in January 2021. [24] ( #cite_note-24 )
In June 2021, El Salvador ( ) became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender ( ) , after the Legislative Assembly ( ) had voted 62–22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele ( ) classifying the cryptocurrency as such. [25] ( #cite_note-25 )
In September 2021, the government of China ( ) , the single largest market for cryptocurrency, declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal, completing a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within China. [27] ( #cite_note-BBC_News-27 )
* The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.
* The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.
Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies, [30] ( #cite_note-30 ) [31] ( #cite_note-31 ) [32] ( #cite_note-32 ) typically shortened to "altcoins" or "alt coins", [33] ( #cite_note-33 ) [34] ( #cite_note-34 ) or disparagingly known as "shitcoins". [35] ( #cite_note-35 ) Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as "alternative versions of bitcoin" [36] ( #cite_note-36 ) given its role as the model protocol for altcoin designers. The term is commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after bitcoin.
Altcoins often have underlying differences with bitcoin. For example, Litecoin ( ) aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin. [37] ( #cite_note-37 ) Another example is Ethereum ( ) , which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain. [38] ( #cite_note-38 ) Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News. [39] ( #cite_note-39 ) In 2016, it had the largest "following" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times. [40] ( #cite_note-40 )
Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System ( ) , corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency. [ citation needed ( ) ] In the case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto ( ). [44] ( #cite_note-te20151031-44 )
As of May 2018 [update] ( ) , over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed. [45] ( #cite_note-FT05142018-45 ) Within a proof-of-work cryptocurrency system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers ( ) is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners ( ) : who use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme. [19] ( #cite_note-primer-19 ) In a proof-of-stake ( ) (PoS) blockchain, transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency, sometimes grouped together in stake pools.
Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation. [46] ( #cite_note-46 ) Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash ( ) on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure ( ) by law enforcement. [1] ( #cite_note-crypto_currency-1 )
The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain ( ). A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records ( ) , called blocks , which are linked and secured using cryptography ( ). [44] ( #cite_note-te20151031-44 ) [47] ( #cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-47 ) Each block typically contains a hash ( ) pointer as a link to a previous block, [47] ( #cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-47 ) a timestamp ( ) and transaction data. [48] ( #cite_note-IPblockchain-48 ) By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger ( ) that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". [49] ( #cite_note-hbr201701-49 ) For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer ( ) network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.
Blockchains are secure by design ( ) and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance ( ). Decentralized ( ) consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain. [50] ( #cite_note-decapp-50 )
In the world of cryptocurrency, a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The node supports the relevant cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions, validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports, when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.
Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organisation or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network. [51] ( #cite_note-51 )
The proof-of-stake ( ) is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme. [21] ( #cite_note-ars1-21 )
In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees ( #Transaction_fees ) by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs ( ) and ASICs ( ) running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt ( ). [52] ( #cite_note-computer201709-52 ) This arms race ( ) for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced in 2009. [52] ( #cite_note-computer201709-52 )
With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. Consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment produces), and the electricity required to run them. [53] ( #cite_note-53 ) Popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. As of July 2019 [update] ( ) , bitcoin's electricity consumption is estimated to about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland. [54] ( #cite_note-54 )
Some miners pool resources ( ) , sharing their processing power ( ) over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block ( ). A "share" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.
As of February 2018 [update] ( ) , the Chinese Government has halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. Many Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada [55] ( #cite_note-55 ) and Texas. [56] ( #cite_note-56 ) One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices. [57] ( #cite_note-57 ) In June 2018, Hydro Quebec ( ) proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW to crypto companies for mining. [58] ( #cite_note-58 ) According to a February 2018 report from Fortune , [59] ( #cite_note-59 ) Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.
In March 2018, the city of Plattsburgh in upstate New York ( ) put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the "character and direction" of the city. [60] ( #cite_note-60 )
An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards ( ) (GPU) in 2017. [61] ( #cite_note-61 ) (The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.) Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 ( ) and GTX 1070 ( ) graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock. [62] ( #cite_note-62 ) A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1100. Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model) was released at an MSRP of $250, and sold for almost $500. RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD ( ) were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available. [63] ( #cite_note-63 )
Nvidia ( ) has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners. "Gamers come first for Nvidia," said Boris Böhles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region. [64] ( #cite_note-64 )
A cryptocurrency wallet ( ) stores the public and private "keys" ( ) (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. [65] ( #cite_note-65 ) With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.
There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet from using paper wallets which are traditional public, private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are dedicated hardware to securely store your wallet information, using a digital wallet which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information, hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded. or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext. [66] ( #cite_note-66 )
Bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous in that the cryptocurrency within a wallet is not tied to people, but rather to one or more specific keys (or "addresses"). [67] ( #cite_note-67 ) Thereby, bitcoin owners are not identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. Still, cryptocurrency exchanges ( ) are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users. [68] ( #cite_note-68 )
Additions such as Monero ( ) , Zerocoin ( ) , Zerocash and CryptoNote ( ) have been suggested, which would allow for additional anonymity ( ) and fungibility. [69] ( #cite_note-69 ) [70] ( #cite_note-70 )
Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances. [71] ( #cite_note-71 )
The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain. Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they further must consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case. [72] ( #cite_note-72 )
The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities. Some sources claim that the current bitcoin design is very inefficient, generating a welfare loss of 1.4% relative to an efficient cash system. The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 Million per year. This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. However, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether. [73] ( #cite_note-73 )
Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply ( ) of network capacity at the time, versus the demand ( ) from the currency holder for a faster transaction. [ citation needed ( ) ] The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest. [ citation needed ( ) ] Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time. [ citation needed ( ) ]
For Ether ( ) , transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit ( ). In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017, [74] ( #cite_note-74 ) while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55. [75] ( #cite_note-75 )
Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism. [76] ( #cite_note-scalabilityOfBitcoinAndNano-76 ) [77] ( #cite_note-”comparativeAnalysis”-77 ) [78] ( #cite_note-blockchainCompared-78 )
Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin ( ) , launched the first bitcoin ATM ( ) in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities. [80] ( #cite_note-80 )
An initial coin offering ( ) (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an "investment contract" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of "tokens") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or Ether. [81] ( #cite_note-81 ) [82] ( #cite_note-82 ) [83] ( #cite_note-83 )
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers ( ) , four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland ( ) as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA ( ) stated that it would take a "balanced approach" to ICO projects and would allow "legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system." In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices. [84] ( #cite_note-84 )
The "market cap" of any coin is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as block chain rewards coded into the architecture technology of Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the "halving", which is when the block rewards received from Bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into Bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of Bitcoin. As the date reaches near of an halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend. [85] ( #cite_note-85 )
By mid-June 2021 cryptocurrency as an admittedly extremely volatile asset class for portfolio diversification had begun to be offered by some wealth managers in the US for 401(k)s ( ). [86] ( #cite_note-86 ) [87] ( #cite_note-87 ) [88] ( #cite_note-88 )
The rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. The Financial Action Task Force ( ) (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as "virtual asset service providers" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering ( ) ( AML ( ) ) and know your customer ( ) (KYC) requirements as financial institutions. [89] ( #cite_note-89 )
In May 2020, the Joint Working Group on interVASP Messaging Standards published "IVMS 101", a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between VASPs. The FATF and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed. [90] ( #cite_note-90 )
In June 2020, FATF updated its guidance to include the "Travel Rule" for cryptocurrencies, a measure which mandates that VASPs obtain, hold, and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers. [91] ( #cite_note-91 ) Subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using JSON ( ) for relaying data between VASPs and identity services. As of December 2020, the IVMS 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it. [92] ( #cite_note-92 )
The European Commission published a digital finance strategy in September 2020. This included a draft regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU. [93] ( #cite_note-93 ) [94] ( #cite_note-94 )
On 10 June 2021, The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( ) proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. For instance, if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth $2 billion, it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire $2 billion. This is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. However, this is a proposal and not a regulation.
The IMF is seeking a co-ordinated, consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies. Tobias Adrian ( ) , the IMF's financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a January 2022 interview that "Agreeing global regulations is never quick. But if we start now, we can achieve the goal of maintaining financial stability while also enjoying the benefits which the underlying technological innovations bring," [95] ( #cite_note-95 )
In 2021, 17 states passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation. [96] ( #cite_note-96 ) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( ) (SEC) is considering what steps to take. On 8 July 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren ( ) , who is part of the Senate Banking Committee ( ) , wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded that it provide answers on cryptocurrency regulation by 28 July 2021, [97] ( #cite_note-97 ) due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this poses to consumers. On 17 February 2022, the Justice department named Eun Young Choi as the first director of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to aid in identification of and dealing with misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. [98] ( #cite_note-98 )
On 18 May 2021, China banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services. [99] ( #cite_note-99 ) This led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work ( ) cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin ( ) fell 31%, Ethereum ( ) fell 44%, Binance Coin ( ) fell 32% and Dogecoin ( ) fell 30%. [100] ( #cite_note-100 ) Proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ). [101] ( #cite_note-101 )
In the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority ( ). Additionally, on 27 June 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that Binance ( ) , the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, [102] ( #cite_note-102 ) cease all regulated activities in the UK. [103] ( #cite_note-ft.com-103 ) Some commentators [ who? ( ) ] believe this is a sign of what is to come in terms of stringent regulation of the UK cryptocurrency market. [103] ( #cite_note-ft.com-103 )
South Africa, who has seen a large amount of scams related to cryptocurrency is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place, that will produce a regulatory framework. [104] ( #cite_note-104 ) The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of Bitcoin ( ). [105] ( #cite_note-regulations-105 ) Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021. [105] ( #cite_note-regulations-105 )
In March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets. This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges are registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea. [106] ( #cite_note-thediplomat.com-106 ) Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts, that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks. [106] ( #cite_note-thediplomat.com-106 )
Turkey's central bank, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey ( ) , banned the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets for making purchases from 30 April 2021, on the ground that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks. [107] ( #cite_note-107 )
At present, India neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market. In 2020, the Supreme Court of India had specifically lifted the ban on cryptocurrency, which was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India. [109] ( #cite_note-109 ) [110] ( #cite_note-110 ) [111] ( #cite_note-111 ) [112] ( #cite_note-112 ) Since then the investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime. But it is being contemplated that the Indian Parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in India. [113] ( #cite_note-113 ) Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy ( ) lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW ( ) (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra ( ) has said that the "cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment". [114] ( #cite_note-114 ) He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it. He favoured following IMF ( ) and FATF ( ) guidelines in this regard.
The legal status of cryptocurrencies ( ) varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool. [115] ( #cite_note-115 ) While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, [116] ( #cite_note-116 ) others have banned or restricted it. According to the Library of Congress ( ) in 2018, an "absolute ban" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An "implicit ban" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. [117] ( #cite_note-RCAWJune2018LOC-117 ) In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association ( ) , are investigating "bitcoin scams" and ICOs ( ) in 40 jurisdictions. [118] ( #cite_note-WaPo52118-118 )
In Russia, though owning cryptocurrency is legal, its residents are only allowed to purchase goods from other residents using Russian ruble ( ) while nonresidents are allowed to use foreign currency. [119] ( #cite_note-119 ) Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems. [120] ( #cite_note-120 )
Cryptocurrency advertisements have been temporarily banned on Facebook ( ) , [122] ( #cite_note-wiredface-122 ) Google ( ) , Twitter ( ) , [123] ( #cite_note-ToISW-123 ) Bing ( ) , [124] ( #cite_note-bing51418-124 ) Snapchat ( ) , LinkedIn ( ) and MailChimp ( ). [125] ( #cite_note-3key-125 ) Chinese internet platforms Baidu ( ) , Tencent ( ) , and Weibo ( ) have also prohibited bitcoin advertisements. The Japanese platform Line ( ) and the Russian platform Yandex ( ) have similar prohibitions. [126] ( #cite_note-126 )
On 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service ( ) (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. Bitcoin is therefore subject to capital gains tax ( ). [127] ( #cite_note-taxstatus-127 ) In July 2019, the IRS issued letters to cryptocurrency owners instructing them to amend returns and pay taxes. [128] ( #cite_note-128 )
As the popularity of and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009, [129] ( #cite_note-129 ) so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals. [130] ( #cite_note-:1-130 )
Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money ( ). Money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers ( ) , however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity ( ).
Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track. [130] ( #cite_note-:1-130 )
Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions. [130] ( #cite_note-:1-130 )
In February 2014, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox ( ) , declared bankruptcy ( ). The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customers' bitcoins likely due to theft, which Mt. Gox blamed on hackers who exploited transaction malleability problems ( ) in the network. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February. [131] ( #cite_note-131 )
Two members of the Silk Road Task Force—a multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of Silk Road ( ) —seized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation. [132] ( #cite_note-Jeong-132 ) DEA ( ) agent Carl Mark Force IV, who attempted to extort Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht ( ) ("Dread Pirate Roberts"), pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice ( ) , and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal prison. [132] ( #cite_note-Jeong-132 ) U.S. Secret Service ( ) agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000 worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with another cryptocurrency theft; he was sentenced to nearly eight years in federal prison. [133] ( #cite_note-133 )
Homero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement ( ) that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme ( ) , and pleaded guilty to wire fraud ( ) in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( ) separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold "investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated" from mining. [134] ( #cite_note-134 )
On 21 November 2017, the Tether cryptocurrency ( ) announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from their primary wallet. [135] ( #cite_note-135 ) The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable). Tether indicates that it is building a new core for its primary wallet in response to the attack in order to prevent the stolen coins from being used.
In May 2018, Bitcoin Gold ( ) (and two other cryptocurrencies) were hit by a successful 51% hashing attack by an unknown actor, in which exchanges lost estimated $18m. [136] ( #cite_note-136 ) In June 2018, Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked ( ) , losing US$37 million worth of altcoin. Fear surrounding the hack was blamed for a $42 billion cryptocurrency market selloff. [137] ( #cite_note-137 ) On 9 July 2018 the exchange Bancor had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen. [138] ( #cite_note-Bancorhack-138 )
The French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers ( ) (AMF) lists 15 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorised to do so in France. [139] ( #cite_note-139 )
A 2020 EU report found that users had lost crypto-assets worth hundreds of millions of US dollars in security breaches at exchanges and storage providers. From 2011 to 2019, between four and 12 breaches were identified a year. In 2019, thefts were reported to have exceeded a value of $1 billion. Stolen assets "typically find their way to illegal markets and are used to fund further criminal activity". [140] ( #cite_note-140 )
According to a 2020 report produced by the United States Attorney General ( ) 's Cyber-Digital Task Force illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall into three categories: "(1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering ( ) and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax ( ) , reporting, or other legal requirements; or (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself." The report concludes that "for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is imperative that these risks be addressed" and that "the government has legal and regulatory tools available at its disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency's illicit uses". [141] ( #cite_note-141 ) [142] ( #cite_note-142 )
According to the UK 2020 national risk assessment—a comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risk in the UK—the risk of using cryptoassets such as Bitcoin for money laundering and terrorism financing is assessed as "medium" (from "low" in the previous 2017 report). [143] ( #cite_note-143 ) Legal scholars suggested that the money laundering opportunities may be more perceived than real. [144] ( #cite_note-144 ) Blockchain analysis ( ) company Chainalysis concluded that illicit activities like cybercrime ( ) , money laundering ( ) and terrorism financing ( ) made up only 0.15% of all crypto transactions conducted in 2021, representing a total of $14 billion. [145] ( #cite_note-145 ) [146] ( #cite_note-146 ) [147] ( #cite_note-147 )
Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets ( ) , such as Silk Road ( ). [130] ( #cite_note-:1-130 ) The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000. [130] ( #cite_note-:1-130 )
Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as "virtual assets". [ citation needed ( ) ] This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets. [148] ( #cite_note-:2-148 ) [ unreliable source? ( ) ]
The Bank for International Settlements ( ) summarized several criticisms of cryptocurrencies in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report. The criticisms include the lack of stability in their price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners. [149] ( #cite_note-bis_report-149 ) [150] ( #cite_note-chapterV-150 ) [151] ( #cite_note-LATHiltzik-151 )
Cryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes ( ) , pyramid schemes ( ) [152] ( #cite_note-152 ) and economic bubbles ( ) , [153] ( #cite_note-153 ) such as housing market bubbles ( ). [154] ( #cite_note-154 ) Howard Marks ( ) of Oaktree Capital Management ( ) stated in 2017 that digital currencies were "nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it", and compared them to the tulip mania ( ) (1637), South Sea Bubble ( ) (1720), and dot-com bubble ( ) (1999). [155] ( #cite_note-155 ) The New Yorker ( ) has explained the debate based on interviews with blockchain founders in an article about the "argument over whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the blockchain are transforming the world". [156] ( #cite_note-156 )
While cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security. [157] ( #cite_note-157 ) Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken measures to dissuade users. [158] ( #cite_note-158 ) However, research in 2021 by the UK's financial regulator suggested such warnings went unheard, or ignored. Fewer than one in 10 potential cryptocurrency buyers were aware of consumer warnings on the FCA ( ) website, and 12% of crypto users were not aware that their holdings were not protected by statutory compensation ( ). [159] ( #cite_note-159 ) [160] ( #cite_note-160 )
Additionally, many banks do not offer services for cryptocurrencies and can refuse to offer services to virtual-currency companies. [161] ( #cite_note-161 ) Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated "widespread use [of cryptocurrency] would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy". He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy. [162] ( #cite_note-162 ) While traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as chargebacks ( ).
The cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches, ICO ( ) or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as a deceptive practice. [163] ( #cite_note-163 ) It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design. [164] ( #cite_note-164 ) Pre-mining means currency is generated by the currency's founders prior to being released to the public. [165] ( #cite_note-165 )
Paul Krugman ( ) , winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ( ) , has repeated numerous times that it is a bubble that will not last [166] ( #cite_note-166 ) and links it to Tulip mania ( ). [167] ( #cite_note-167 ) American business magnate Warren Buffett ( ) thinks that cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending. [168] ( #cite_note-168 ) In October 2017, BlackRock ( ) CEO Laurence D. Fink ( ) called bitcoin an "index of money laundering ( ) ". [169] ( #cite_note-169 ) "Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world," he said.
As the first big Wall Street bank to embrace cryptocurrencies, Morgan Stanley ( ) announced on 17 March 2021 that they will be offering access to Bitcoin ( ) funds for their wealthy clients through three funds which enable Bitcoin ( ) ownership for investors with an aggressive risk tolerance. [170] ( #cite_note-170 ) BNY Mellon on 11 February 2021 announced that it would begin offering cryptocurrency services to its clients. [171] ( #cite_note-171 )
In October 2021, financial services company Mastercard ( ) announced it is working with digital asset manager Bakkt ( ) on a platform that would allow any bank or merchant on the Mastercard network to offer cryptocurrency services. [174] ( #cite_note-174 )
Mining for proof-of-work ( ) cryptocurrencies consumes significant quantities of electricity and has a large associated carbon footprint ( ). [175] ( #cite_note-175 ) Proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ) , Litecoin ( ) , and Monero ( ) were estimated to have added 3 to 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017. [176] ( #cite_note-176 ) By November 2018, Bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, rivalling nations like Jordan ( ) and Sri Lanka ( ). [177] ( #cite_note-177 )
Critics have also identified a large electronic waste problem in disposing of mining rigs ( ). [178] ( #cite_note-178 ) Mining hardware is improving at a fast rate, quickly resulting in older generations of hardware. [179] ( #cite_note-179 )
Bitcoin ( ) is the least energy-efficient cryptocurrency, using 707.6 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction. [180] ( #cite_note-180 ) In comparison, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, uses 62.56 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction. [181] ( #cite_note-181 ) Ripple ( ) ($ XRP ( ) ) is the world's most energy efficient cryptocurrency, using 0.0079 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction. [182] ( #cite_note-laptopmag-182 )
A few papers concluded that variable renewable energy ( ) power stations could invest in Bitcoin mining to reduce curtailment ( ) , hedge ( ) electricity price risk ( ) , stabilize the grid, increase the profitability of renewable energy ( ) power stations and therefore accelerate transition to sustainable energy ( ). [183] ( #cite_note-Fridgen2021-183 ) [184] ( #cite_note-Rhodes2021-184 ) [ failed verification ( ) ] [185] ( #cite_note-185 ) [ failed verification ( ) ] [186] ( #cite_note-186 ) [187] ( #cite_note-187 ) [188] ( #cite_note-188 ) [189] ( #cite_note-189 ) [190] ( #cite_note-190 )
There are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware ( ) and software ( ). [191] ( #cite_note-191 ) Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets. [192] ( #cite_note-192 )
In September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed ( ) academic journal ( ) Ledger ( ) ( ISSN ( ) 2379-5980 ( ) ) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh ( ). [193] ( #cite_note-193 )
The journal encourages authors to digitally sign ( ) a file hash ( ) of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped ( ) into the bitcoin blockchain ( ). Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers. [194] ( #cite_note-194 ) [195] ( #cite_note-195 )
A number of aid agencies ( ) have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including the American Red Cross ( ) , [ citation needed ( ) ] UNICEF ( ) , [196] ( #cite_note-ibtimesunicef-196 ) and the UN World Food Program ( ). [ citation needed ( ) ]
Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation said that UNICEF would uphold existing donor protocols, meaning that those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to UNICEF. [197] ( #cite_note-197 ) [198] ( #cite_note-198 )

*Last Week in Cryptocurrency:* In a viral Super Bowl ad, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ( ) ) offered a promotion giving away $15 in free Bitcoin to new users; the customer response crashed the company's app ( ) for several minutes. Also, digital investment advisor Betterment moved into the crypto space ( ) by acquiring robo-advisory firm Makara, which offers cryptocurrency, for an undisclosed sum. Finally, largest global crypto exchange Binance has made a $200 million strategic investment ( ) in print and digital publisher Forbes in support of the latter's planned merger with a special purpose acquisition company ( ) (SPAC) later in the quarter.
Bitcoin has not only been a trendsetter, ushering in a wave of cryptocurrencies built on a decentralized peer-to-peer ( ) network, but has also become the de facto standard for cryptocurrencies, inspiring an ever-growing legion of followers and spinoffs.
Before we take a closer look at some of these alternatives to Bitcoin (BTC) ( ) , let’s step back and briefly examine what we mean by terms like cryptocurrency ( ) and altcoin ( ). A cryptocurrency, broadly defined, is virtual or digital money that takes the form of tokens or “coins.” Though some cryptocurrencies have ventured into the physical world with credit cards or other projects, the large majority remain entirely intangible.
The “crypto” in cryptocurrencies refers to complicated cryptography that allows for the creation and processing of digital currencies and their transactions across decentralized systems. Alongside this important “crypto” feature is a common commitment to decentralization; cryptocurrencies are typically developed as code by teams who build in mechanisms for issuance (often, although not always, through a process called mining ( ) ) and other controls.
Cryptocurrencies are almost always designed to be free from government manipulation and control—although, as they have grown more popular, this foundational aspect of the industry has come under fire. The cryptocurrencies modeled after Bitcoin are collectively called altcoins, and in some cases, shitcoins ( ) , and have often tried to present themselves as modified or improved versions of Bitcoin. Though some of these currencies may have some impressive features that Bitcoin does not, matching the level of security that Bitcoin’s networks achieve largely has yet to be seen by an altcoin.
Below, we’ll examine some of the most important digital currencies other than Bitcoin. First, though, a caveat: It is impossible for a list like this to be entirely comprehensive. One reason for this is the fact that there are nearly 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence as of February 2022. Though many of these cryptos have little to no following or trading volume, some enjoy immense popularity among dedicated communities of backers and investors.
Beyond that, the field of cryptocurrencies is always expanding, and the next great digital token may be released tomorrow. Though Bitcoin is widely seen as a pioneer in the world of cryptocurrencies, analysts adopt many approaches for evaluating tokens other than BTC. It’s common, for instance, for analysts to attribute a great deal of importance to ranking coins relative to one another in terms of market capitalization. We’ve factored this into our consideration, but there are other reasons why a digital token may be included in the list.
Cryptocurrencies are intended for payments, transmitting value (akin to digital money) across a decentralized network of users. Many altcoins (i.e., those that are not Bitcoin or sometimes Ethereum) are classified in this way and may sometimes be called value tokens.
There are also blockchain-based tokens that are meant to serve a different purpose from that of money. One example could be a token issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) ( ) that represents a stake in a blockchain ( ) or decentralized finance (DeFi) ( ) project. If the tokens are linked to the value of the company or project, they can be called security tokens (as in securities like stocks, not safety).
Other tokens have a particular use case or function. Examples include Storj tokens, which allow people to share files across a decentralized network, or Namecoin, which provides decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) service for Internet addresses. These are known as utility tokens.
Today, while many users of crypto understand and appreciate these differences, traders and lay investors may not notice the difference because all categories of token tend to trade on crypto exchanges ( ) in the same way.
* *Best Crypto Exchanges for 2022* ( ) : We reviewed and compared the cost, security, and features of the best crypto exchanges. This list will help you find the best crypto exchange to fit your needs.
The first Bitcoin alternative on our list, Ethereum (ETH) ( ) , is a decentralized software platform that enables smart contracts ( ) and decentralized applications (dApps) ( ) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. The goal behind Ethereum is to create a decentralized suite of financial products that anyone in the world can freely access, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or faith. This aspect makes the implications for those in some countries more compelling because those without state infrastructure and state identifications can get access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, or a variety of other financial products.
The applications on Ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Ether (ETH) is like a vehicle for moving around on the Ethereum platform and is sought mostly by developers looking to develop and run applications inside Ethereum, or now, by investors looking to make purchases of other digital currencies using ether. Ether, launched in 2015, is currently the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization ( ) after Bitcoin, although it lags behind the dominant cryptocurrency by a significant margin. Trading at around $3,150 per ETH as of February 2022, ether’s market cap is just over half of bitcoin's.
In 2014, Ethereum launched a presale for ether, which received an overwhelming response; this helped to usher in the age of the ICO. According to Ethereum, it can be used to “codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.” Following the attack on the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) ( ) in 2016, Ethereum was split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) ( ).
In December 2020, Ethereum transitioned its consensus algorithm from proof of work (PoW) ( ) to proof-of-stake (PoS) ( ). This move is intended to allow Ethereum’s network to run itself with far less energy and improved transaction speed, as well as to make for a more deflationary economic environment. PoS allows network participants to “stake” their ether to the network. This process helps to secure the network and process the transactions that occur. Those who do this are rewarded with ether, similarly to how an interest account works. This is an alternative to Bitcoin’s PoW mechanism, by which miners receive more BTCs for processing transactions.
Litecoin (LTC) ( ) , launched in 2011, was among the first cryptocurrencies to follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and has often been referred to as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” It was created by Charlie Lee, an MIT graduate and former Google engineer.
Litecoin is based on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority and uses scrypt as a PoW, which can be decoded with the help of consumer-grade central processing units (CPUs). Although Litecoin is like Bitcoin in many ways, it has a faster block generation rate and thus offers a faster transaction confirmation time.
Other than developers, there are a growing number of merchants that accept Litecoin. As of February 2022, Litecoin has a market capitalization of $9.3 billion and a per token value of around $135, making it the 21st-largest cryptocurrency in the world.
Cardano (ADA) ( ) is an “Ouroboros proof-of-stake” cryptocurrency that was created with a research-based approach by engineers, mathematicians, and cryptography experts. The project was co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the five initial founding members of Ethereum. After having some disagreements with the direction that Ethereum was taking, he left and later helped to create Cardano.
The team behind Cardano created its blockchain through extensive experimentation and peer-reviewed research. The researchers behind the project have written more than 120 papers on blockchain technology across a range of topics. This research is the backbone of Cardano.
Due to this rigorous process, Cardano seems to stand out among its PoS peers as well as other large cryptocurrencies. Cardano has also been dubbed the “Ethereum killer” because its blockchain is said to be capable of more. That said, Cardano is still in its early stages. Though it has beaten Ethereum to the PoS consensus model, it still has a long way to go in terms of DeFi applications.
Cardano aims to be the world’s financial operating system by establishing DeFi products similar to Ethereum's as well as providing solutions for chain interoperability, voter fraud, and legal contract tracing, among other things. As of February 2022, Cardano has the sixth-largest market capitalization at $38.5 billion, and one ADA trades for around $1.20.
Polkadot (DOT) is a unique PoS cryptocurrency aimed at delivering interoperability among other blockchains. Its protocol is designed to connect permissioned and permissionless blockchains as well as oracles to allow systems to work together under one roof. Polkadot’s core component is its relay chain, which allows the interoperability of varying networks. It also allows for parachains, or parallel blockchains with their own native tokens for specific-use cases.
Where Polkadot differs from Ethereum is that rather than creating just dApps on Polkadot, developers can create their own blockchain while also using the security that Polkadot’s chain already has. With Ethereum, developers can create new blockchains but need to create their own security measures, which can leave new and smaller projects open to attack because the larger a blockchain, the more security it has. This concept in Polkadot is known as shared security.
Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, another member of the core founders of the Ethereum project who had differing opinions about the project’s future. As of February 2022, Polkadot has a market capitalization of roughly $24.5 billion, and one DOT trades for $22.60.
Bitcoin Cash BCH ( ) holds an important place in the history of altcoins because it is one of the earliest and most successful hard forks ( ) of the original Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency world, a fork takes place as the result of debates and arguments between developers and miners. Due to the decentralized nature of digital currencies, wholesale changes to the code underlying the token or coin at hand must be made due to general consensus; the mechanism for this process varies according to the particular cryptocurrency.
When different factions can’t agree, sometimes the digital currency is split, with the original chain remaining true to its original code and the new chain beginning life as a new version of the prior coin, complete with changes to its code.
BCH began its life in August 2017 as a result of one of these splits ( ). The debate that led to the creation of BCH had to do with the issue of scalability; the Bitcoin network has a limit on the size of blocks: 1 megabyte (MB). BCH increases the block size from 1MB to 8MBs, with the idea being that larger blocks can hold more transactions within them, and the transaction speed would therefore increase. It also makes other changes, including the removal of the Segregated Witness protocol that impacts block space.
Stellar (XLM) ( ) is an open blockchain network designed to provide enterprise solutions by connecting financial institutions for the purpose of large transactions. Huge transactions between banks and investment firms—typically taking several days, involving a number of intermediaries, and costing a good deal of money—can now be made nearly instantaneously with no intermediaries and cost little to nothing for those making the transaction.
Though Stellar has positioned itself as an enterprise blockchain for institutional transactions, it is still an open blockchain that anyone can use. The system allows for cross-border transactions among any currency. Stellar’s native currency is Lumens (XLM). The network requires users to hold Lumens to be able to transact on the network.
Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb, a founding member of Ripple Labs and developer of the Ripple protocol. He eventually left his role with Ripple and went on to co-found the Stellar Development Foundation. Stellar Lumens have a market capitalization of just under $6 billion and are valued at around 25 cents as of February 2022.
Dogecoin (DOGE) ( ) , seen by some as the original “memecoin,” caused a stir in 2021 as the price of the coin skyrocketed. The coin, which uses an image of the Shiba Inu as its avatar, is accepted as a form of payment by some major companies, including the Dallas Mavericks, Kronos, and—perhaps most notably—SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer owned by Elon Musk ( ).
Dogecoin was created by two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, in 2013. Markus and Palmer reportedly created the coin as a joke, commenting on the wild speculation of the cryptocurrency market.
The price of DOGE hit an all-time high of approximately 0.74 cents during the week when Musk was scheduled to appear on Saturday Night Live. As of February 2022, Dogecoin’s market capitalization is $21.7 billion and one DOGE is valued at around 16 cents, making it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency.
Binance Coin (BNB) ( ) is a utility cryptocurrency that operates as a payment method for the fees associated with trading on the Binance Exchange. It is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Those who use the token as a means of payment for the exchange can trade at a discount.
Binance Coin’s blockchain is also the platform on which Binance’s decentralized exchange operates. The Binance Exchange was founded by Changpeng Zhao and is one of the most widely used exchanges in the world based on trading volumes.
Binance Coin was initially an ERC-20 token ( ) that operated on the Ethereum blockchain. It eventually had its own mainnet launch. The network uses a PoS consensus model. As of February 2022, Binance Coin has a $73.5 billion market capitalization, with one BNB valued at $436.
Tether (USDT) ( ) was one of the first and most popular of a group of so-called stablecoins ( ) —cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their market value to a currency or other external reference point to reduce volatility. Because most digital currencies, even major ones like Bitcoin, have experienced frequent periods of dramatic volatility ( ) , Tether and other stablecoins attempt to smooth out price fluctuations to attract users who may otherwise be cautious. Tether’s price is tied directly to the price of the U.S. dollar. The system allows users to more easily make transfers from other cryptocurrencies back to U.S. dollars in a more timely manner than actually converting to normal currency.
Launched in 2014, Tether describes itself as “a blockchain-enabled platform...to make it easier to use fiat currency digitally.” Effectively, this cryptocurrency allows individuals to utilize a blockchain network and related technologies to transact in traditional currencies while minimizing the volatility and complexity often associated with digital currencies.
Monero XMR ( ) is a secure, private, and untraceable currency. This open-source cryptocurrency was launched in April 2014 and soon garnered great interest among the cryptography community and its enthusiasts. The development of this cryptocurrency is completely donation-based and community-driven.
Monero has launched with a strong focus on decentralization and scalability, and it enables complete privacy by using a special technique called “ring signatures.” With this technique, a group of cryptographic signatures appears, including at least one real participant, but the real one cannot be isolated because they all appear valid.
Because of these exceptional security mechanisms, Monero has developed something of an unsavory reputation—it has been linked to criminal operations around the world. Though this is a prime candidate for making criminal transactions anonymously, the privacy inherent in Monero is also helpful to dissidents of oppressive regimes around the world.
We were only able to list 10 altcoins above, but there are many other important cryptocurrencies out there, and they jockey for position over time in terms of user bases, market value, and influence. Some other important cryptocurrencies include (as of February 2022) but are not limited to:

DigiByte DGB $0.025 $0.40 DigiByte is more than a faster digital currency. It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and secure authentication.
As decentralized platforms, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies allow individuals to engage in peer-to-peer financial transactions or enter into contracts. In either case, there is no need for some trusted third-party intermediary such as a bank, monetary authority, court, or judge. This has the potential to disrupt the existing financial order and democratize finance. The size of the cryptocurrency space has grown exponentially in the past decade, with new innovations and a collective market capitalization of more than $1.75 trillion.
Many cryptocurrencies have gained importance or hold the promise to do so. Dogecoin, for example, was a meme-based joke coin that reached fame when Tesla CEO Elon Musk promoted the token on social media. Aside from Dogecoin and the others listed above, several other Bitcoin forks also exist, such as Bitcoin Gold ( ) and Bitcoin SV. Other important coins include Ripple (XRP) ( ) , Solana, USD Coin, and Tezos.
Despite thousands of competitors that have sprung up, Bitcoin—the original cryptocurrency—remains the dominant player in terms of usage and economic value. Each coin (BTC) was worth roughly $44,000 as of February 2022, with a market capitalization of more than $830 billion.

The Internet has left plenty of dead and maimed paper-based institutions in its wake. If Gavin Andresen and his underground cadre of cypherpunks have their way, another archaic slice of pulped tree may be next: the dollar.
Bitcoin is a grassroots nonprofit project that seeks to fashion a new currency out of little more than cryptography, networking and open-source software, and Andresen is the closest thing the project has to a director. Bitcoin is not, he explains, just a new way to digitally spend dollars, pounds and yen. That's been tried before. Remember Beenz and Flooz?
Bitcoin is different: It wholly replaces state-backed currencies with a digital version that's tougher to forge, cuts across international boundaries, can be stored on your hard drive instead of in a bank, and--perhaps most importantly to many of Bitcoin's users--isn't subject to the inflationary whim of whatever Federal Reserve chief decides to print more money.
"Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people," says Andresen, a 44-year-old software developer and entrepreneur based in Amherst, Mass. "This is like better gold than gold."
As with shiny-metal-backed currencies, Bitcoins derive their value partly through their scarcity, which is defined not by how much can be dug up with shovels but by a cryptographic lottery. Anyone can get Bitcoins without paying cash for them by downloading and running Bitcoin's "mining" program. The machines in Bitcoin's mining network, now in the thousands, compute an encryption function called a "hash" on a set of random numbers, and coins are awarded every ten minutes to whichever miner happens to compute a number below a certain threshold.
That lottery tightly controls how many Bitcoins are created. There are currently close to 6 million in existence. By 2014 there will be about twice that number. Bitcoin's distributed software is set to slow production over time so that there will never be more than 21 million in circulation. "No banker can control it. No evil dictator tyrant can print zillions and destroy the value," says Bruce Wagner, organizer of New York's Bitcoin developer's meet-up.
Of course, the other factor that determines the worth of a currency is whether anyone will accept it in exchange for goods and services. And for Bitcoin, a subculture of geek-friendly merchants is catching on. About $30,000 worth of Bitcoins change hands every day in electronic transactions, spent on Web-hosting, electronics, dog sweaters and alpaca socks.
Also drugs. Particularly illegal ones. Since Bitcoins can be spent on the Internet without the use of a bank account, they offer a convenient system for anonymous purchases. There's no centralized storage of funds, so accounts can't be frozen by law enforcement or PayPal administrators. "Illegal stuff will be a niche for Bitcoin," admits Andresen. "That bothers me, but it's just like any currency. You can't stop dollar bills from being used for the drug trade either. That's an unfortunate feature of any cashlike system."
Bitcoins' anonymity was no accident. The system was originally designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious, privacy-obsessed figure who first described the currency's specs in a series of posts on a cryptography e-mail list in late 2008. Nakamoto declined to be interviewed for this story, and not even Andresen, who took over the project as technical lead in May 2010, has communicated with Bitcoin's founder except through e-mail and posts on Web forums. Nakamoto has compared Bitcoin to the systems of anonymous financial transactions sought by the anarchist cypherpunk movement in the 1990s, whose adherents saw cryptography as a way to shift power from institutions to individuals.
That possibly irrational exuberance may be a sign that Bitcoin is headed for a speculative bubble. The currency already swings as much as 50% in value over some single days. But Bitcoin's supporters are confident the free market can solve that problem as Bitcoin's advantages attract more nonspeculative buying and selling.
One way they hope to bring more normals into the fold: by expanding Bitcoin's applications to the real world. Bitcoin devotees in New York's informal developer group are rolling out an Android app for mobile Bitcoin buying. They're also building open-source software that can be integrated into point-of-sale terminals.
"Someday this will probably have the Fed scrambling," says the New York meet-up's Bruce Wagner. "They still don't know what Twitter is. By the time they figure this out, it will have already taken hold."----

CHICAGO (Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.O ( ) and rival Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N ( ) plan to publish new pricing data on bitcoin that they say will increase credibility and transparency for the controversial digital currency.
Starting in the fourth quarter, the CME aims to begin publishing bitcoin prices about once a second during trading days and a daily settlement price based on transactions from several bitcoin spot exchanges, the company said on Monday.
Bitcoin is a Web-based “cryptocurrency” used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. Despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in.
The CME’s pricing data “will lower uncertainty among market participants and would very likely reduce bitcoin’s traditionally high volatility” by aggregating information on transactions from multiple bitcoin markets, said Paul Chao, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options.
The New York Stock Exchange, owned by the ICE, is evaluating whether to include data from a number of exchanges for a daily settlement price it has published since May 2015, said Dwijen Gandhi, head of indexes for the NYSE. Currently the settlement price is based only on transaction data from U.S. market Coinbase.
Earlier on Monday, Australian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself as the creator of bitcoin. Experts were divided over whether he really was the elusive person who has gone by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto until now.----

A cryptocurrency system can be understood as a system intended for the issuance of tokens which are intended to be used as a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange, and which are accounted for using an often collectively-maintained digital ledger making use of cryptography to replace trust in institutions to varying extents. Against such a backdrop, the singular term cryptocurrency can mean a token, intended to be used as a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange, issued via a cryptocurrency system.
A cryptocurrency system can be understood as a system intended for the issuance of tokens which are intended to be used as a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange, and which are accounted for using an often collectively-maintained digital ledger making use of cryptography to replace trust in institutions to varying extents. Against such a backdrop, the singular term cryptocurrency can mean a token, intended to be used as a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange, issued via a cryptocurrency system.
The term cryptocurrency entered public usage with the surge of Bitcoin in 2008—a protocol aimed at enabling a network of people connected together via peer-to-peer digital communications infrastructure to issue digital tokens and transfer them between themselves whilst securing the process through cryptography (Nakamoto, 2008). While the original proposition did not use the term cryptocurrency , Nakamoto presented the project as a peer-to-peer 'currency' in a network and cryptography mailing list (Nakamoto, 2009).The term 'cryptocurrency', however, soon gained traction in online-chatter (compare HXN (2009) and print media (e.g., Davis, 2011). 1 ( #footnote1_hcyumdi ) An early distinction was made between the protocol—using the capitalised term Bitcoin —and the tokens, which used the lower-case term bitcoin. New bitcoins are ‘written into existence’ by a network participant (a so-called miner) who has succeeded in transforming the format of a bundle of proposed transactions (of previously issued bitcoins, along with a single request to issue new ones as a reward) in such a way that the bundle can be hitched to a chain of previously hitched bundles.
The word stem crypto within the term cryptocurrency might be seen as surrogate for cryptography , but could also have emerged from the cypherpunk movement, who identified “anonymous cash and other untraceable payment systems” (De Filippi & Wright, 2018, p. 19) as enabling feature within a crypto-anarchy (Ludlow, 2001, p. 4). Bitcoin's mission of leveraging “cryptographic proof instead of trust” (Nakamoto, 2008, p. 1) resonates with the above. The exact protocol specifications of Bitcoin and its descendants are summarised in Scheuermann and Tschorsch (2016). Cryptography enters its architecture in various ways. A few examples are the integrity of, and consensus on a joint transaction history as well as the authorisation setup for sending tokens. However, the use of the surrogate crypto for Bitcoin is slightly arbitrary in the sense that earlier attempts at creating digital currencies (compare e.g. Chaum, 1988) relied heavily on cryptographic techniques as well. Nevertheless, it might seem justified by the fact that cryptography plays a far more central role for Bitcoin than it does for national currencies.
Loosely speaking, the modern fiat monetary system consists of physical and digital credits—issued by state central banks, state treasuries, and private commercial banks—which circulate under a legal system that guarantees their redemption. The number of credits expands through issuance, after which they can be transferred in the course of exchange among those who use them, before being retired when they are returned to the issuers. This composite system of expandable-contractable credits is what we refer to as ‘money’ in everyday parlance. In this context, the term cryptocurrency is controversial, because—from its inception—the name has simply assumed that the tokens are money tokens. The controversy is amplified by the fact that enthusiasts sometimes use the term performatively to make the normative point that crypto tokens ‘should be money’, or—alternatively—to deny that what we currently call ‘money’ is in fact money. One strategy to negotiate these language politics is to initially strip the money assumption from the tokens by giving them the generic name crypto-tokens , and then listing their uncontroversial characteristics to compare them with fiat credits.
Tokens of early cryptocurrencies are data objects created through accounting, much like the act of typing out the number ‘1’ creates the mental image of a ‘thing’. This is what is referred to as a ‘token’, but they are ‘blank tokens’. An example of a blank token in the physical world might be a clear plastic token with no inscription or rights attached to it. Bitcoin tokens, similarly, are empty signifier s, somewhat like the digital equivalent of blank physical tokens, but with strict supply limits 2 ( #footnote2_gkfy43s ). These blank digital tokens however, are promoted with a name and branded logo that serves as a mental image for them, without which they would be almost entirely featureless. The tokens can be said to be digital bearer instruments , in the sense that transfers can only be initiated by the possessor of a private key that can unlock an ‘unspent transaction output’. The ‘bearer-instrument-like’ nature is one reason why cryptocurrency sometimes gets referred to as ‘digital cash’ (physical cash being the bearer-instrument form of fiat currency). The tokens move around—Bitcoin and some of its descendants are processing hundreds of thousands of transfers of tokens every day (compare Hileman and Rauchs, 2017). Furthermore, they have a price measured in fiat currency and their tokens can be split into smaller pieces, or combined into larger ones. The fact that split-able and lump-able tokens with a fiat currency price can be moved gives the system a ‘moneylike’ feeling, and—under a shallow definition of money as something that is issued and moved around in association with commerce —the term cryptocurrency feels loosely plausible in everyday conversation.
Most ‘purchases’ conducted with bitcoin tokens, however, take the form of countertrade. The token, priced in fiat currency, is compared to a good or service, priced in fiat currency, and from this comparison of two fiat currency prices emerges an exchange ratio between the token and the good or service. This is the conceptual equivalent of superimposing a pair of two-way fiat currency transactions over each other and cancelling out the money flows, giving the residual appearance of the crypto-token being used as ‘money’ to ‘pay’ for a good or service.
Nevertheless, Bitcoin is used primarily for speculation (Baur, 2018)—buying the token with fiat currency with an intention to resell it for fiat currency—rather than using it to countertrade (‘pay’) for goods and services. This speculation (compare, among others, Yermack, 2015; Glaser et al., 2014; or Cheah, 2015) drives volatility in the fiat currency price of tokens, which—when analysed through the lens of the conventional ‘functions of money’ paradigm favoured by economic textbooks (money as a medium-of-exchange, a store-of-value and a unit-of-account), poses problems for the ‘moneyness’ of the tokens. Not only are they not widely accepted in exchange for goods and services, but they are not widely used to price things, and attempts to provide prices are unintuitive 3 ( #footnote3_rtkipkl ) (Yermack, 2015). They also struggle to consistently ‘store value’, if we interpret that to mean ‘maintain stable purchasing power’ (which in the case of Bitcoin means ‘maintain fiat price and countertrade ratios’). Put simply, while a person can generally predict how many bags of sugar US$ 100 will command in a month, they will be very uncertain as to how much sugar they can obtain through Bitcoin countertrade in a month.
Beyond these debates about the validity of the original use of the term cryptocurrency , the term has been destabilised by the proliferation of alterations to traditional cryptocurrency systems. The role of cryptography and ‘moneyness’ implied by the diverse token designs varies considerably and will be discussed in the remainder of the section.
A useful classification of projects from a technical standpoint involves rights for writing and reading transaction records. Peters et al. (2016) introduced a popular categorisation that can be used to classify the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrency systems along the dimension “public” vs. “private” and “permissioned” vs. “permissionless”. In public-permissionless systems every participant in the network (node) can read transactions and write others to the ledger. For public-permissioned systems, only authorised nodes can write. In private permissioned systems, finally, even reading is restricted to authorised nodes. The more “private” and “permissioned” in its underlying infrastructure a system is, the further it is from the cypherpunk vision.
An example of a recent development trend holding true to the aim of replacing trust by cryptographic proof found in archetypal cryptocurrencies (compare Nakamoto, 2008; and Genkin et al., 2018) are so-called privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies or ‘privacy coins’ (e.g., Zcash, n.d.; Monero, n.d.). They are closely related to archetypal cryptocurrencies and replicate their public-permissionless setup of rights to read and write. As “alternative cryptocurrencies designed with the goal of providing stronger privacy guarantees than Bitcoin” (Genkin et al., 2018) they even increase the use of cryptography to ensure anonymity. As a consequence of their focus on privacy, however, they are leading to rising concerns with respect to anti-money-laundering and law enforcement (compare Tziakouris, 2020; or Ferrari, 2020).
The broad trajectory in recent years, however, has been to decrease the centrality of cryptography in the respective implementations. Even permissioned payment systems run by corporations but still called cryptocurrencies entered the stage. 4 ( #footnote4_gw9cz85 ) Eyal (2017) concludes that “if attendees at recent blockchain events are any indication, cryptocurrencies have caught the attention of the mainstream financial technology (FinTech) sector” (Eyal, 2017, p. 39). With traditional business starting to experiment with the technology inspired by Bitcoin, system requirements—and with it the respective security setups and use of cryptography—changed. The economic design for these more centralised payment systems led to the reestablishment of trusted third parties or intermediaries for token creation to a certain degree.
While many novel cryptocurrencies are far from the crypto-anarchist roots of archetypal token designs, the general idea of the replacement of trust in institutions or their internal governance mechanisms by cryptography still plays a role in all cryptocurrency designs. However, given that even fiat bank payments use cryptography for security, mere reliance on cryptography for security should not enter a definition of cryptocurrencies. 5 ( #footnote5_dtpdq7k )
Early cryptocurrencies had the declared intent of creating ‘digital cash’ or currency (see section 1.1.), but the proliferation of crypto token forms have destabilised how this is conceptualised. Not all development strands feature the objective of proposing general purpose monetary tokens.
First-layer tokens (e.g. Ether) that underlie smart contract platforms 6 ( #footnote6_sg0522q ) (e.g. Ethereum), and informally even second-layer tokens (tokens running on respective platform) are called cryptocurrencies , but they exist first and foremost to activate smart contracts rather than aiming to provide a payment solution for goods and services more generally (see Bartoletti, 2017). Nevertheless, this more ‘limited purpose’ focus can be a strength, insofar as smart contract activation can be seen as a real service accessible via possession of the token, thereby ‘anchoring’ the tokens into a ‘real economy’, albeit one in cyberspace.
However, also ‘general purpose’ tokens are marked by changes. A response to the inherent instability in prices of archetypal cryptocurrency was the advent of ‘stablecoins’, which try to solve the issue of high volatility in purchasing power of Bitcoin and its descendants (Pernice, 2019). Stablecoins are tethered or pegged to fiat currencies, or ‘backed’ in some way with assets that have fiat currency prices. They are thus no longer ‘blank’ empty signifiers, and contain some reference point that is easier to estimate and communicate. There are very different types of stablecoins, and recently several frameworks have tried to unify and abstract existing stabilisation techniques (e.g., Bullmann et al., 2019; Pernice et al., 2019; Moin et al., 2020; Sidorenko, 2019; Clark et al., 2020). A national currency can be ‘tokenized’ by issuing a digital promise for it on a blockchain system, and such tokenised funds might indeed be categorised as a “new form of electronic money” (Blandin et al., 2019) falling under the respective regulations for e-money, anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing regulations. This might ensure “moneyness” at least from a legal standpoint. With more complex stablecoin designs the legal case is not always clear, but from an economic standpoint their stability in purchasing power might contribute to an increase in their adoption as money in the future. Stablecoins, for now however, haven’t seen mainstream adoption in retail markets yet (Bullmann et al., 2019).
Many scientific publications simply assume the meaning of the term cryptocurrency to be common knowledge or, at most, sketch it roughly. 7 ( #footnote7_mwxaaet ) Instead, we followed the evolution of the term starting with Bitcoin to define what cryptocurrency is understood as today. The neologism cryptocurrency is unstable in its meaning, and is applied to systems with diverse technical architectures and governance systems. Nevertheless, one way to unify the diverse uses of the term is to define it by some common intent among those who claim it, rather than by the diverse means via which that intent is enacted, and regardless of whether the intent is achieved in practice. We find that cryptocurrency systems are unified by being intended to host a general or limited-purpose medium-of-exchange , a cryptocurrency, using infrastructure that replaces trust in institutions by cryptography to varying degrees.
To make the term more useful in public discourse, cryptocurrency should be coupled with specifying classifications from economic (e.g., Bullmann et al., 2019; Pernice et al., 2019; Moin et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2020), governance (e.g., Ziolkowski et al., 2020; Beck et al., 2018; Hacker, 2019) or technological (e.g., Cachin and Vukoli, 2017; Peters et al., 2016) points of view.

Contrary to the early view that cryptocurrencies’ decentralisation makes them unregulable, the formation of new intermediaries will guarantee regulators’ ultimate power. The key challenge is how to balance control and innovation.
Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are often seen as a threat by governmental and financial institutions worldwide. Regulation could help minimise the risks involved. The author explores some legal and self-regulatory precedents from which we can learn.
Bitcoin is the first decentralised, peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of ownership of virtual currencies without the need for a trusted third party. The purpose of this article is to address how we can capture Bitcoin’s potential benefits for the economy while addressing new regulatory challenges.
Cryptocurrencies have now become commonplace in the online world. Although most of the media attention is focused on decentralised payment systems, the true revolution is happening at a much deeper level, argue Primavera de Filippi and Raffaele Mauro.

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nick-szabo-if-banks-want-benefits-blockchains-they-must-go-permissionless-1518874

"But their bureaucracies are so heavily invested in the expertise and importance of local regulations and standards that it's extremely difficult for them to cut the Gordian knot and implement seamless global systems.
"So they keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through 'permissioning'; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability."
Szabo reiterated the point: to remove vulnerability banks also have to remove individual human control and the individuals in charge or with root access. Banks naturally hate that loss to their power. But they don't have any choice if they want to gain the benefits of having an army of independent computers that rigorously, constantly and securely check each others' work, he said.
"There are half a dozen or so different entities involved when you do a stock trade on Wall Street, again checking each others' work. You typically see full vulnerability to unaccountable third parties only in pathological situations where naive newcomers try to do money on the centralised web, as with Mt.Gox.
"But the traditional 'human blockchain' is very labor-intensive and very local — each is based on local regulations and customs and thus splits the world up into mutually untrusting national silos. Permissionless blockchains cut through that like Alexander cutting through the Gordian knot."
IBTimes asked Szabo if he expected smart contract execution and other decentralised apps on censorship-resistant systems like Ethereum to challenge financial and legal institutions with a ferocity similar to that of Bitcoin.
"However, the Ethereum community needs to learn to reverse-engineer legal and other traditional patterns instead of trying to re-invent society from scratch. That will take some time to figure out how to do well. It will also take some time for the Ethereum platform to technologically mature, as it has with Bitcoin."
Financial contracts that have clearly-defined rules and can be collateralised are generally viewed as low-hanging fruit within the brave new world of smart contracts. Recently, UBS came out of the bushes with a smart bonds platform built on Ethereum.
Szabo said bonds are good example of a financial instrument suited to smart contracts because they could be backed by other assets that exist on the blockchain, if the bond issuer itself fails to make a payment.
"These can be performed predominantly by 'dry code' (interpreted by computers rather than lawyers) and thus automated and trust-minimised (vulnerability-minimised) for seamless operations across borders.
"More prosaically, most construction contracts involve quality aspects that probably won't anytime soon be specified well enough for a robot to be able to judge whether the work has been satisfactorily completed. This kind of thing will long remain the domain of 'wet code' — traditional law interpreted by lawyers rather than computers."
Bitcoin transaction volumes are expected to increase in the years ahead and the debate over how and when to increase headroom (size of blocks are currently limited to 1MB) was in the headlines recently.
Szabo favours Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille's proposal, a security-conscious approach using limiting-resource figures and scenarios which argues for about a 20% or less per year increase in block size.
Szabo provided the analogy of a "box size debate" over the number of dollar bills that could be fitted into an armoured car. One side of the debate says we should try to carry as many pieces of paper in the truck as possible in order to allow it to handle small denominations. They want to turn the armoured car into a big moving van, said Szabo.
The other side argues that truck should be smaller and heavily armoured. You can move more dollar bills in the moving van, much like Visa can do many more transactions per second than Bitcoin. To do that you have to remove some armour — you have to reduce the security.
"You'd have to hire more security guards and money-counters instead, and you'd have to depend more on the local laws to protect you. With block size too, as with the 'box size' of our money-carrying truck, there is a security vs. performance trade-off.
"If you reduce the redundancy of messages to allow for larger block sizes, beyond the growth of limiting-resource technology, that reduces the automated integrity that makes Bitcoin distinctive in financial IT.
"It creates avenues of attack and it would end up becoming more dependent on the human blockchain of accountants, investigators and lawyers for its integrity. It would be more labour-intensive and nationally siloed like traditional IT systems."
Visa and PayPal have much higher transactions per second than Bitcoin (analogous to Szabo's bigger truck moving more dollar bills), but they are more labour-intensive and often difficult to use across national borders.
"If that's the tradeoff you want to make, Visa and PayPal already exist, and within national borders they do what they do quite well. It's silly to try to turn Bitcoin into yet another Visa and PayPal," he said.
"That means that large-B Bitcoin (the blockchain) will evolve into a high-value settlement system: as it grows it won't turn into a big moving van carrying many more pieces of paper (transactions per second); instead it will be an armoured car that can carry higher denominations (higher value per transaction). That means we will need other systems to do small-b bitcoin (the currency) retail payments."
"It's completely reasonable, even if some Bitcoin currency purists wouldn't like it, to have credit and debit card payments denominated in Bitcoin rather than dollars, and net settled on Bitcoin instead of on Fedwire.
"And in the future we will have vulnerability-minimised ("trust-minimised" in the technical lingo) and thus global retail payment systems closely linked to the Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning network."----

*There’s nothing like a dollar bill for* paying a stripper. Anonymous, yet highly personal—wherever you use it, that dollar will fit the occasion. Purveyors of Internet smut, after years of hiding charges on credit cards, or just giving it away for free, recently found their own version of the dollar—a new digital currency called Bitcoin ( ).
You’ll know it when you see it (strippers who accept tips in bitcoins advertise their account addresses right on their bodies). And more important, if you pay with it, no one needs to know. Bitcoin balances can flow between accounts without a bank, credit card company, or any other central authority knowing who is paying whom. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network, and it doesn’t care who you are or what you’re buying.
In the long run, a system like this, which restores privacy to electronic payments, could do more than just put the sneak back into the peek. If enough people take part, Bitcoin or another system like it will give political dissidents a new way to collect donations and criminals a new way to launder their money—while causing headaches for traditional financial gatekeepers.
You may have heard about Bitcoin last year, when the digital currency was briefly a major media story and speculators rushed to cash in on the rising value of bitcoins. Or perhaps you heard about hackers raiding the coffers of the largest online bitcoin exchanges, which coincided with the price of bitcoins plunging. Since January Bitcoin has stabilized. It’s been holding an exchange rate of about US $5 ( ).
The dream of an anonymous, independent digital currency—one where privacy is maintained for buyers and sellers—long predates Bitcoin. Despite obituaries in magazine articles from Forbes ( ) , Wired ( ) , and The Atlantic ( ) , the dream is far from dead.
*The pursuit of an* independent digital currency really got started in 1992, when Timothy May, a retired Intel physicist, invited a group of friends over to his house outside Santa Cruz, Calif., to discuss privacy and the nascent Internet. In the prior decade, cryptographic tools, like Whitfield Diffie’s public-key encryption and Phil Zimmermann’s Pretty Good Privacy, had proven useful for controlling who could access digital messages. Fearing a sudden shift in power and information control, governments around the world had begun threatening to restrict access to such cryptographic protocols.
May and his guests looked forward to everything those governments feared. “Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions,” he said. By the end of the meeting, the group had given themselves a name—“cypherpunks”—and the superhero-like task of defending privacy across the digital world. In just a week, cofounder Eric Hughes wrote a program that could receive encrypted e-mails, scrub away all identifying marks, and send them back out to a list of subscribers. When you signed up, you got a message from Hughes:
Hughes and May were deeply aware that financial behavior communicates as much about you as words can—if not more. But outside of cash transactions or barter, there’s no such thing as a private transaction. We rely on banks, credit card companies, and other intermediaries to keep our financial system running. Will those corporations save and even share a dossier of your spending habits? Even using cash requires trust that the bill will maintain its worth. Will governments print too much currency or too little? Many cypherpunks would say that the only way to answer these questions is to build an entirely new system.
Gradually, their mistrust germinated into an anarchist philosophy. Most simply wanted to be able to buy things without someone looking over their shoulders. But others on the mailing list imagined liberating currency from governmental control and then using it to lash back at their perceived oppressors.
Jim Bell, a onetime Intel engineer, took these fancies further than anyone, introducing the world to an odious thought experiment called an assassination market. Citizens needed an effective way to punish politicians who acted against the wishes of their constituents, he reasoned, and what better punishment than murder? With an anonymous digital coin, argued Bell, you could pool donations from disgruntled citizens into what amounts to bounties. If a politician made enough people angry, it would only be a matter of time before the price pushed him out of office or cost him his life. Bell’s essay, “ Assassination Politics ( ) ,” eventually attracted the attention of federal agents. His spiral through the U.S. court system ( ) started with an IRS raid in 1997 and ended this March with his release from prison ( ).
While cypherpunks like Bell were dreaming up potential uses for digital currencies, others were more focused on working out the technical problems. Wei Dai had just graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in computer science when he created b-money in 1998. “My motivation for b-money was to enable online economies that are purely voluntary,” says Dai, “ones that couldn’t be taxed or regulated through the threat of force.” But b-money was a purely personal project, more conceptual than practical.
Around the same time, Nick Szabo, a computer scientist who now blogs about law and the history of money, was one of the first to imagine a new digital currency from the ground up. Although many consider his scheme, which he calls “ bit gold ( ) ,” to be a precursor to Bitcoin, privacy was not foremost on his mind. His primary goal was to turn ones and zeros into something people valued. “I started thinking about the analogy between difficult-to-solve problems and the difficulty of mining gold,” he says. If a puzzle took time and energy to solve, then it could be considered to have value, reasoned Szabo. The solution could then be given to someone as a digital coin.
In Szabo’s bit gold scheme, a participant would dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic equations assigned by the system. “Anything that works well as a proof-of-work function, producing a specific binary string such that it can be proved that generating that string was computationally costly, will work,” says Szabo. In a bit gold network, solved equations would be sent to the community, and if accepted, the work would be credited to the person who had done it. Each solution would become part of the next challenge, creating a growing chain of new property. This aspect of the system provided a clever way for the network to verify and time-stamp new coins, because unless a majority of the parties agreed to accept new solutions, they couldn’t start on the next equation.
When attempting to design transactions with a digital coin, you run into the “ double-spending problem ( ).” Once data have been created, reproducing them is a simple matter of copying and pasting. Most e-cash scenarios solve the problem by relinquishing some control to a central authority, which keeps track of each account’s balance. DigiCash, an early form of digital money ( ) based on the pioneering cryptography of David Chaum, handed this oversight to banks. This was an unacceptable solution for Szabo. “I was trying to mimic as closely as possible in cyberspace the security and trust characteristics of gold, and chief among those is that it doesn’t depend on a trusted central authority,” he says.
Bit gold proved that it was possible to turn solutions to difficult computations into property in a decentralized fashion. But property is not quite cash, and the proposal left many problems unsolved. How do you assign proper value to different strings of data if they are not equally difficult to make? How do you encourage people to recognize this value and adopt the currency? And what system controls the transfer of currency between people?
*After b-money and* bit gold failed to garner widespread support, the e-money scene got pretty quiet. And then, in 2008, along came a mysterious figure who wrote under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto,” with a proposal for something called Bitcoin. As is fitting for the creator of a private digital currency, Nakamoto’s true identity remains a secret. “I’ve never heard of anybody who knew about that name earlier,” says Szabo. “And I’m not going to speculate on who he may or may not be.”
The simplest way to understand Bitcoin is to think of it as a digital ledger book. Imagine a bunch of people at a table who all have real-time access to the same financial ledger on laptops in front of them. The ledger records how many bitcoins each person at the table has at a given time. By necessity, the balance of each account is public information, and if one person wants to transfer funds to the person sitting across from him, he has to announce that transaction to everyone at the table. The entire group then appends the transaction to the ledger, which they all need to agree on. In a system like this, money never has to exist in a physical form, and yet it can’t be spent twice.
This is basically how Bitcoin works, except that the participants are spread across a global peer-to-peer network, and all transactions take place between addresses on the network rather than individuals. Address ownership is verified through public-key cryptography, without revealing who the owner is.
The system turns traditional banking privacy on its head: All transactions are made in public, but they’re difficult to link up with a human identity. Maintaining the dissociation takes vigilance on the part of the Bitcoin user and careful decisions about which outside applications and exchange methods to use, but it can be done. “Anonymity is typically compromised by means outside of Bitcoin’s control, in other words,” says Jeff Garzik, who is on the team of programmers now responsible for developing the Bitcoin software. Bitcoin is often described as providing pseudoanonymity, by creating enough obfuscation to provide users with plausible deniability.
People who own bitcoins have a program—called the Bitcoin client—installed on their computers to manage their accounts. When they want to access their funds, they use the client to send a transaction request. The innovation of Bitcoin is to use the processing of these transaction requests as the mechanism for creating new currency.
As requests pile up in the system, individual computers, running “mining” programs, bundle them into chunks called transaction blocks. Before each block of transactions becomes part of the accepted Bitcoin ledger, or block chain, the mining software must transform the data using cryptographic hash equations. The Bitcoin client accepts the resulting hash values only if they meet strict criteria, so miners typically need to compute many hash values before stumbling upon one that meets the requirements. That process costs a lot of computing power—so much that it would be prohibitively difficult for anyone to come along and redo the work. Each new block that gets added and sealed strengthens all the previous blocks on the chain.
The “miner” whose computer first finds an acceptable hash value is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins. The Bitcoin system adjusts the difficulty of the hashing requirements to control the minting rate. To its proponents, this is one of Bitcoin’s biggest attractions: Unlike the printing of “fiat” currency, which can be done on demand, the creation of Bitcoins will gradually taper until it reaches a limit of 21 million coins.
As more and more miners compete to process transactions, mining requires more computing power. Brock Tice, who mines bitcoins in St. Paul, Minn., has a whole room stuffed full of enough mining computers to heat his office in the winter. But Tice first became interested in the network for a different reason. He thought it would be a better way to accept money from customers online.
In 2009, he began selling little blue canary-shaped night-lights from his home in New Mexico. He quickly lost patience with all the standard payment options. “I had been thinking for a while that something like Bitcoin was needed,” he says. “I run a couple of small businesses, and taking or making payments is just such a huge pain.” Every time a customer pays with PayPal, for instance, Tice hands over 2.9 percent of what he charges plus a small fee. For international sales, he pays even more. The rates for Google Checkout and credit cards are about the same, and for each one he has to open an account with the company processing the transaction, and then trust that it will eventually hand over the money. After reading about how Bitcoin works, Tice decided to include it as a payment method on his website.
For merchants like Tice, the benefits are obvious. In addition to relieving him of fees (at least for now—Bitcoin has an optional mechanism in place for miners to collect fees in the future), Bitcoin transactions won’t open him up to claims of credit card fraud. In Bitcoin, all transactions are irreversible.
On the other hand, unlike credit card users, consumers paying with bitcoins have no way to get their money back if Tice never ships the item. But as with any financial transaction, some level of trust is still required. And some customers would prefer to trust a merchant to make good on a sale than trust them to protect sensitive data. Last spring, hackers broke into the Sony PlayStation Network and swiped a trove of private account details—credit card numbers, birthdays, log-ins, passwords, home addresses, and all the names associated with them. Just days later, it happened again, and within a week the security of more than 100 million Sony accounts was at risk. “I think Bitcoin really has the potential to change our expectations about what information we give merchants,” says Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s project leader.
The Bitcoin system has had its own hacking problems. Other than a few die-hard miners, most people buy bitcoins at an exchange where you pay dollars, euros, or whatever and get bitcoins in return. These exchanges also allow merchants to convert their bitcoin collections into other currencies. Unfortunately, the security of the exchanges hasn’t been as good as the Bitcoin client itself. The largest online exchange, Mt. Gox, lost 500 000 bitcoins to hackers in June 2011, which sent the price barreling down. Anyone who invests in a bitcoin better understand that it’s going to be more volatile than the dollar, says Michael Kagan, the managing director at ClearBridge Advisors, an investment firm in New York City.
Even with the ups and downs, many of Bitcoin’s early adopters amassed their virtual fortunes when mining was easy, so they have an incentive to keep the system going (assuming they didn’t cash out at the peak of the bubble). It’s possible they are hoarding the currency, as the economist Paul Krugman speculated they would, waiting for the price to rise again as mining becomes more competitive and expensive. And while Bitcoin’s fixed minting rate helped attract its most fervent early adopters, it also made the barrier to entry much higher for people who want to join now. “If anything is the Achilles’ heel of Bitcoin, that probably is it,” Szabo says.
If Bitcoin does fail, it may die in an act of cannibalism. Nakamoto introduced the block chain, but cryptographers are now already working on improvements. The minting rate is only one of many things that could be tweaked. “Bitcoin is the first of a new breed,” says Garzik. “People will learn from Bitcoin and build something better, or Bitcoin’s critical mass will force it to evolve and learn from its own mistakes.”
Morgen E. Peck never saw the point in writing about money or finance. Then she attended a conference on the cryptocurrency Bitcoin ( ) and talked to anarchists, programmers, bankers, cryptographers, libertarians, finance lawyers, and a game show host. From this crucible of ideas, she emerged quite altered. “I’d like to personally thank Satoshi Nakamoto [Bitcoin’s supposed creator] for finally making money interesting enough to write about,” she says.

Dreaming inspires the heart, motivating us to overcome the adamantine hurdles that inevitably arise. Seeing my mother’s hard work and success as a physician, I dreamed of being an engineer when I was in high school. I was inspired by the success of my family members who are well-recognized and decorated for their research in the field of medicine.
In the early 1940s, my grandmother was the first woman in the entire Indian state of Jind, India, to earn an undergraduate degree. My parents were awarded the B.C. Roy Award ( ) , the highest honor doctors can receive in India, from the country’s president. My father also received the Padma Shri Award ( ) , which recognizes citizens’ contributions in various fields including arts, education, science, and others.
After completing my engineering bachelor’s degree at Thapar University ( ) in Patiala, India, I started working as a software developer. Despite my 60-hour workweeks, I made it a priority to pursue a postgraduate diploma in finance and information technology, to grow in my career.
I chased an even bigger dream—to become a corporate leader—so I pursued a full-time MBA from Southern Methodist University ( ) , in Dallas. Thereafter, I worked in supply-chain management and project management, leveraging my business school–acquired knowledge. Although my lack of career progression baffled me for nearly a decade, I kept going.
Always looking for opportunities, I applied to several doctoral programs in the United States. I jumped at the opportunity of earning a Ph.D. in computer science last year from the University of North Texas ( ) , in Denton.
Before joining the university’s doctoral program, I was conducting research at its Multimedia Information Group laboratory. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and subsequently exploded worldwide, I was already working on solving medical image diagnosis problems using artificial intelligence at the lab. I saw the necessity and potential benefits of research on COVID-19 using artificial intelligence on lung imaging.
For my long hours of concentrated work on groundbreaking science I have received several accolades, awards, and recognitions internationally. I recently won the Best Presentation award for research on using artificial intelligence to assess the severity of COVID-19 in patients to help with diagnosis at the 2021 International Conference on Digital Image Processing ( ) and at the 2021 International Conference on Biomedical Imaging, Signal Processing ( ).
I presented and published my work in peer-reviewed journals and conference papers about COVID-19, addressing disease diagnosis, triage, localization, and severity quantification with superior generalizability using machine learning analyses on lung imaging. My pioneering research was carried out at UNT’s Multimedia Information Group laboratory. It employed supervised deep-learning approaches in automated image analysis.
The research is instrumental not just for COVID-19 but for all diseases that manifest in lung imaging. My work can help physicians more efficiently and accurately diagnose the coronavirus and assess its severity.
Sometimes sheer luck can bring about isolated instances of success, but hard work always prevails to bring about sustained success. Consistent hard work, persistence, forbearance, patience, satisfaction, tenacity, self-faith, self-confidence, and faith in God compose my secret sauce to success.
Such qualities mold our character and help remove hurdles. Three years ago, my 10-year-old daughter was an average student. After seeing me happily working so hard, she became inspired and surprised me. She suddenly became awesome in academics, winning several awards including the school President’s Award, as well as medals in extracurricular activities and a win in the school’s spelling bee.
My tenacity, persistent hard work, graduate studies, and faith in myself fueled my success in becoming a proud single parent and homeowner. I invited several female middle- and high-school students to my graduation celebration in December.
My successful work and research in computer vision and deep-neural networks in school and most recently at CVS Health ( ) , where I work as a data scientist, has made a difference and has boosted local, corporate, and national economic growth.
Quantum computers can theoretically find the answers to problems no classical computer could ever solve, but they rely on a delicate state known as entanglement ( ) that is vulnerable to disruption from its surroundings. Now scientists reveal that “photonic topological insulators” could help protect entanglement for potential use in quantum computing.
At the heart of the most widely explored types of quantum computers are components known as quantum bits, or qubits. Whereas conventional computers switch transistors either on or off to symbolize data as 1s and 0s, the bizarre nature of quantum physics lets qubits exist in a state known as superposition where they can act as both 1 and 0, essentially allowing each qubit to perform multiple calculations at once.
The more qubits are quantum-mechanically connected—or entangled—the more calculations they can simultaneously perform. However, entangled states are fragile against disturbances from their environment such as heat or vibrations, which makes scaling up quantum computers a challenging task.
One potential way to defend entangled states from their environment involves exotic materials called topological insulators, in which electricity ( ) , light ( ) , or sound ( ) flows across only surfaces and edges, with virtually no dissipation of energy. Now scientists in Australia, China, and England have developed an integrated photonic chip that can protect entanglement via topology.
Topology ( ) is the branch of mathematics that explores what aspects of shapes can survive deformation. For example, an object shaped like a doughnut can be deformed into the shape of a mug, so that the doughnut’s hole becomes the hole in the cup’s handle. However, the object couldn’t lose the hole without changing into a fundamentally different shape.
Employing insights from topology, researchers developed the first electronic topological insulators in 2007 ( ). Electrons that run along the edges or surfaces of these materials are “topologically protected,” meaning that the patterns in which the electrons flow will stay unchanged in the face of any disturbances they might encounter, a discovery that helped win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016 ( ). Scientists later designed photonic topological insulators ( ) , in which light is similarly protected, as well as acoustic topological insulators ( ).
Scientists around the world have investigated ways in which topological protection could make quantum computers more robust against outside interference. However, creating electronics that combine topological protection with quantum entanglement has proven difficult ( ) , in part because these phenomena often each require extreme conditions, such as extreme cold, ultrahigh vacuum and powerful magnetic fields.
In the new study, instead of seeking to produce topologically protected entanglement in electronic devices, the researchers created a robust photonic silicon chip. Their CMOS device worked under ambient temperature and pressure without the need for extreme cold, vacuum, or magnetic fields.
The scientists fabricated their photonic topological insulator with a lattice of 280 identical silicon rings each 61 micrometers wide. When pairs of entangled photons were sent into this array, they flowed topologically protected along opposite edges of the lattice, with entanglement surviving even when the scientists added structural defects into this array.
Previously ( ) , different research groups had achieved topological protection of entangled photons ( ) in arrays of nanowires, but this new work is the first time such topological protection was shown in a photonic chip, “with transport of entangled photons along edges from one point to another,” says Mordechai Segev ( ) , a physicist at the Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, who did not participate in this study. “It’s what you’d want for quantum computation.”
The research team noted that their integrated chip was compact and plug-and-play compatible, and that topologically protected entangled photons could serve as qubits in fault-tolerant quantum computers ( ) and find use in highly secure quantum communications networks ( ). They cautioned that their device may not possess resilience against certain fabrication imperfections, such as the roughness in the walls of the silicon rings that can cause light to reflect backwards within the lattice.
In Segev’s opinion, photonics will ultimately prove the winning platform in quantum computation, spearheaded by groups such as Palo Alto startup PsiQuantum ( ) , Canadian startup Xanadu ( ) , and the Chinese effort underlying the machine known as Jiuzhang ( ). A photonic topological platform such as that displayed in the new study may lead to more robust photonic quantum computing “with a reasonable price to pay in fabrication,” Segev says.

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039184/bitcoin-developer-talks-regulation-open-source-and-the-elusive-satoshi-nakamoto.html

A Bitcoin core developer for three years, he left his job at Red Hat on Friday to start work at Bitpay, the biggest Bitcoin payment processing service. IDG News Service caught up with him at the Bitcoin 2013 ( ) conference in Silicon Valley this weekend, ( ) where he talked about the state of Bitcoin today, the parallels with open source, and Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto. Following is an edited transcript of the conversation.
*IDGNS:* What’s on people’s minds at Bitcoin 2013? It feels like the Wild West ( ) right now—the exchange rate’s up and down, the government’s starting to regulate, there are startups cropping up everywhere, where are we at?
*Garzik:* Bitcoin’s growing up. It’s been a hobbyist-grown organic piece of software, an organic community. I was one of the hobbyists. It grew up slowly, slowly, slowly over time, and now VCs are all over the place trying to write checks. As a developer, I’ve told several people, I don’t want your check. I just started work for a startup called Bitpay, my first day is today.
For a long time the Bitcoin developers were working at Fortune 500 companies like Red Hat and Google. You didn’t know if Bitcoin would be a success, we have families and have to support ourselves, so we all had non-Bitcoin jobs. This is sort of the watershed where developers are starting to be employed by Bitcoin companies, Bitcoin companies are starting to see outside investors, and the number of users is going through the roof. This is its coming out period.
*Garzik:* There’s a race on. In order to legally service customers in the U.S., you have to register with the federal government, with FinCEN [the treasury department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network], and you have to obtain licensing with 48 out of 50 U.S. states. That’s what the Mt. Gox thing ( ) was all about, it wasn’t an attack on Bitcoin, it was a specific compliance issue.
*Garzik:* That’s what that seizure was all about, it was specifically saying that they were violating the money transmission regulations, and money-transmission licensing is what the exchanges all need. So you have four or five exchanges that are racing to get all the licenses, because the prize at the end is going to be U.S. customers.
*Garzik:* Some of the exchanges are going after only accredited investors, which is a legal slot you can fit into. [Accredited investors include registered investment companies and individuals whose net worth exceeds $1 million]. Other exchanges go for one or two states, they say we’ll register with the feds, which is easy, and then get licenses in, say, California and New York and serve those customers.
*Garzik:* It’s definitely an issue, but to make a plug for my new employer, Bitpay lets people pay with bitcoins and then merchants receive U.S. dollars, so that removes the volatility for merchants. For individuals, I think it’s going to be volatile for another year or two, simply because, mathematically, it’s a thinly traded market.
*Garzik:* Correct. If a hedge fund trader has a million dollars and wants to make a big Bitcoin buy, Bitcoin’s going to go through the roof. If he sells the coins the next day, it goes through the floor. It behaves the same way as a Nasdaq penny stock, because there’s a limited number of liquid tradeable bitcoins on the market.
*Garzik:* That’s essentially modeled after natural resource extraction, gold mining and coal mining. Initially there’s a whole lot, but every year you mine, there’s less and less new gold introduced and the market slowly adjusts. If you released all 21 million bitcoins at once it would be even more volatile. It’s an important part of the predictability of Bitcoin and where a lot of its value comes from.
*Garzik:* I don’t think so. There are a lot of Bitcoin businesses springing up, as you can see around here, also the FinCEN guidance ( ) from a few months ago indicated they’re treating it, as we predicted, as a private currency. Long before computers existed, private currencies existed and the laws around that are pretty well known.
*Garzik:* Exactly. There was a case with the Liberty Dollar, where a gentleman tried to make coins that actually looked like U.S. currency. The FBI and the federal government shut him down. But we’re not pretending this is U.S. dollars, there’s no confusion.
*Garzik:* I’m an engineer through and through. I saw it on Slashdot about a year after Satoshi [Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin and has never made his identity public] mined the first block in January 2009.
*Garzik:* I was a kernel engineer with Red Hat. What I was doing there is remarkably analogous to what I’m doing now. Red Hat paid me but they didn’t tell me what to work on, they paid me to be an OS engineer and contribute to Linux, so I would send my changes to Linus Torvalds. Same thing here, Bitpay isn’t paying me to work on Bitpay, they’re paying me to work on open source.
*Garzik:* A lot of people are into the whole libertarian aspect, I think of it more as an interesting engineering project. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was impossible. How can you have a purely digital currency? Can’t I just copy your hard drive and have your bitcoins? I didn’t understand how that could be done, and then I looked into it and it was brilliant.
*IDGNS:* There’s a lot of powerful hardware coming onto the market for mining bitcoins [mining is how new bitcoins enter the system]. What is there to stop, say, Google from loading the Bitcoin software into one of its data centers and mining all the remaining bitcoins?
*Garzik:* Technically nothing, but in practice CPUs are powerless against ASICs [custom chips designed specifically for Bitcoin mining]. Google would have to manufacture its own ASICs for that to have an impact, and that’s never really been a worry. The worry now is who controls the foundries that produce the chips, so you have to think a couple of levels up.
*Garzik:* I would never recommend Bitcoin as a nation state currency that you’re forced to use, but I think it’s great as a private currency that you’re free to choose if you want to. It’s just very frictionless, you can trade it with free software.
The biggest hurdle may be the volatility, as you suggested. For regular users, I agree that’s off-putting to a certain extent. I think it’s something that will diminish over time, but it’s a free market so there’s no guarantee. Just introducing new people ( ) to Bitcoin is hard as well. It’s technologically complex, how do I explain it to my aunt? But then, to a certain extent you don’t have to understand it, you can download a Bitcoin wallet in the Android market, scan a QR code and you have bitcoins.
*Garzik:* : My personal opinion of him as a project leader is that he’s not a good project leader. My opinion of him as an engineer is that he’s a mediocre engineer. My opinion of him as an architect-slash-economist is that he’s brilliant. He released Bitcoin and there were a bunch of obvious bugs and attacks that got fixed in the first six months, then there were less serious bugs that got fixed. He designed the system, fundamentally it works and it hasn’t been hacked, but the software is sort of a crap program.
*Garzik:* In the early days, when we had Wikileaks wanting to use bitcoins for donations, Satoshi came up on the forum and said, Please don’t do that, it’s a system in its infancy, we don’t need all this conflict and controversy right now.
*Garzik:* You’d have to use Tor, and if you send me bitcoins and another person sends me bitcoins, I have to sort of keep those in two separate pools. If I spend them both together, a network analysis can tie you, the other person and me together, so you might not even know who that other person is but suddenly we three are linked through network analysis.----




https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/wary-of-bitcoin-a-guide-to-some-other-cryptocurrencies/

It might have passed you by, but an essential part of the Internet's infrastructure took a heavy knock last week. The Silk Road—you know, the website where you can buy any drug imaginable ( ) —was subjected ( ) to a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
Calling the Silk Road "essential" might seem an exaggeration, but it isn't if you're one of its many regular users. The same goes if you're a regular user of Bitcoin—its journey to mainstream acceptance began with the Silk Road, as it's perfect for anonymous, untraceable transactions (as long as you're careful not to make your identity obvious, of course).
Right now, Bitcoin is undeniably a mainstream currency, even if it is not necessarily popular in the sense of being used by a significant proportion of society. But it is viewed as a legitimate method of payment, and a legitimate asset, by the people who matter in these issues—CNBC has it as a ticker on its website ( ) , for example, and there's a Bitcoin hedge fund in Malta ( ).
That isn't to say Bitcoin doesn't have issues, though. The Bitcoin bubble ( ) was a fascinating game of musical chairs played out over several months—everyone knew the music would stop, but nobody wanted to guess when that might be while there was easy money to be made. Also, DDoS attacks have been incredibly effective at manipulating Bitcoin's value. Closing a large exchange like Mt. Gox ( ) , even if only for a few hours at a time, could cause enough of a price fluctuation for canny hackers to buy low and sell high at their own whim.
For all the Bitcoin hype, it's not hard to see that there's a big problem in how bitcoins are actually used. That comes from Bitcoin being both a currency and a commodity in its current form. Its rise in value has been the thing to make it famous, but that's also the thing that has undermined its usefulness as a currency. If you're someone who wants to accept bitcoins as part of a business, then having to update your prices every minute isn't necessarily useful—nor is the worry that deflation might discourage coins from circulating, or the worry that the whole thing could pop without warning.
Businesses have started accepting Bitcoin to their credit. There's a whole neighborhood in Berlin that's seemingly converted en masse, while the range of online services that accept it—from WordPress ( ) to OK Cupid ( ) —is now long enough to be essentially pointless in listing. This is significant in showing that Bitcoin is now a legitimate currency.
We may be entering a new period in how we pay for things online with Bitcoin as the first example of theory put into practice. Like many new and radical ideas, its implementation has been sketchy and inconsistent. Naysayers decry it as a scam or a Ponzi scheme. Its acolytes proclaim it a crucial weapon in the liberation of the individual from the corporatist banking system and government regulation of commerce.
This argument sees Bitcoin being to currencies and online markets what Napster was to music piracy. The popularity of Bitcoin might well have put the whole system under an immense amount of stress but the underlying concept is an attractive one—a cryptographically secure and anonymous currency that doesn't take a cut from transactions (like, say, Amazon's virtual currency ( ) ) and remains independent of any single, central authority.
For many people, the risks—from fraud, for instance—are outweighed by the benefits. So let's say you're not convinced by Bitcoin as it is, but you still like Satoshi Nakamoto's ( ) idea of "an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third-party." Luckily for you, there are alternatives out there. Here are some of the more interesting ones, all forked from the original Bitcoin code.
The most prominent alternative to Bitcoin, Litecoin works upon the same fundamental principles. However, it's positioned not just as an alternative to Bitcoin but a complementary cryptocurrency—" the silver to Bitcoin's gold ( )."
Apart from the problems with price fluctuation, Bitcoin had some fundamental infrastructure issues that weren't anticipated by many of its early adopters. The blockchain—the entire core of the concept—has come under increasing strain as Bitcoin has become more popular.
In its simplest terms, the blockchain is the record of every single transaction on the Bitcoin network. Every transaction is public, and the blockchain continues to grow as it contains the full record of every exchange since Bitcoin started.
This has some weird consequences—while it's easy to make yourself anonymous, it's also easy to track those anonymous transactions. This is how Sergio Lerner worked out ( ) that Satoshi Nakamoto has a fortune of 980,000 bitcoins, worth $113.8 million. If Bitcoin owners aren't careful about how they spend that money, it could reveal their identity.
Roughly every 10 minutes, a new blockchain is generated and disseminated throughout the Bitcoin network by each node, and the version that becomes the accepted, canonical version is the one that is disseminated by the greatest number of nodes. It is, in a way, democratic.
However, something very worrying happened on March 11, when the blockchain forked into two. For roughly six hours, there were effectively two versions of Bitcoin in operation. This shouldn't happen. It was only resolved when one chain eventually " pulled ahead ( ) " of the other, becoming established as the legitimate blockchain again.
Litecoin was founded in October 2011 in recognition that this kind of problem was probably going to happen if Bitcoin became popular. Merchants require large numbers of small value transactions happening quickly, something that Bitcoin isn't really well-suited for. Larger transactions, happening more slowly (remember, new blockchains generate every 10 minutes) are more suited to it.
That's why Litecoin has a faster transaction time (roughly two and a half minutes) than Bitcoin. With four times as many coins in circulation, it theoretically offers smaller divisions of coins to make smaller transaction values more feasible.
It also uses a hashing algorithm— scrypt ( ) —which is supposed to keep Litecoin mining realistic for desktop users, as opposed to the standard SHA256d algorithm used by Bitcoin which becomes more time- and power-intensive as time goes on. Mining both litecoins and bitcoins at the same time isn't just possible, it's encouraged by Litecoin's developers. Whether Litecoin is more or less secure than Bitcoin as a result is a passionate ( ) debate ( ) within the cryptocurrency community.
While a user has to go to an exchange like Vircurex ( ) to buy litecoins, Mt. Gox has announced ( ) plans to add support for it in the near future (though when exactly is unclear, thanks to the wave of DDoS attacks). Being on the largest Bitcoin exchange could give Litecoin an extra layer of legitimacy through association.
Currently, support for the currency is limited to the kinds of places that Bitcoin was restricted to in its early days— uselitecoin.com ( ) lists casinos and cryptocurrency news sites, with the Pirate Bay being the most prominent supporter.

The Parliament of El Salvador has passed with 62 out of 84 votes a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele to classify Bitcoin as legal tender, thus becoming the first country in the world to adopt a cryptocurrency. Its use as legal tender will go into law in 90 days.
Bukele has touted the use of Bitcoin ( ) for its potential to help Salvadorans living abroad send remittances back home while saying the US dollar will also continue as legal tender. “It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,” Bukele said in a tweet shortly before the vote.
The President added that the use of Bitcoin shall remain optional and it will not entail any risks to users. “The government will guarantee the convertibility to the exact value in dollars at the moment of each transaction,” Bukele said.
El Salvador’s dollarized economy relies heavily on money sent back from citizens working abroad. World Bank data showed remittances to the country made up nearly $6bn, about a fifth of GDP, in 2019, one of the highest ratios in the world.
The IMF’s head of mission for El Salvador, Alina Carare, said late on Monday that the fund is “following the news and will have more information as we continue our consultations with the authorities.”
Carlos de Sousa, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, said the Bitcoin push looked ill-considered with Bukele potentially shooting himself in the foot by making the raising of tax revenue more difficult. “Cryptocurrencies are overall a very easy way to avoid taxation and a very easy way to simply avoid the authorities because it’s a completely decentralised system, you can do money laundering, you can do tax avoidance and so on,” he said.
A cryptocurrency is a digital form of money that can be used to pay for some transactions online. As with “real” currencies, one, 10, or millions of Bitcoins can be owned. Unlike real currencies, cryptocurrencies only exist online and are not backed by any government or central bank. Crypto devotees say the currencies represent the economy of the future. But ultimately, their value depends on their limited supply and the number of people who chase after them.
The cryptocurrency market grew to more than US $ 2.5 trillion in mid-May last year, according to the CoinMarketCap page, driven by interest from increasingly serious investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. But the volatility currency – currently priced at US $ 36,127 – and its murky legal status has raised questions about whether it could ever replace fiat currency in day-to-day transactions.----




https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/cubas-central-bank-now-recognizes-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html

Resolution 215, which was published Thursday in the state-run Official Gazette ( ) , says the central bank will set new rules for how to deal with digital currencies. Commercial providers of related services will now need a license from the central bank to continue operations.
The American embargo on the communist state has turned Cuba into a pariah in the global economy. Cuba's decision to join El Salvador ( ) in embracing decentralized virtual cash could help the country to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime, which was dialed up under former President Donald Trump ( ) and has been extended under President Joe Biden ( ).
"This is a conservative government still set in traditional Marxist ways. In fact, the communist Cuban central bank was founded by Che Guevara. The fact that they are cautiously regulating shows they are interested in what it can bring them," Boaz said.
Sending and receiving money between the U.S. and Cuba became extremely difficult under the Trump administration, according to Dr. Mrinalini Tankha, a professor of anthropology at Portland State University, who has been doing research on Cuba for 10 years.
In 2020, Western Union, a particularly significant channel for remittances that had been operating in Cuba for more than 20 years, shuttered all of its 400-plus locations, amid increasingly aggressive Trump-era sanctions.
Before the Covid outbreak, Tankha said, some Cubans would turn to underground and somewhat semi-formalized courier services called mulas, where agencies would carry cash to Cuba and distribute it to people on the island. But as the pandemic grounded flights around the world, even this path to cash became much more difficult, she said.
She credits the burgeoning crypto community for the rise of the internet in Cuba, as well as the fact that there are so many more people who have smartphones and 3G connectivity. A weak local currency is also a factor likely contributing to the appeal of bitcoin.
"If you're a software developer, or if you're an NFT artist, you could actually get paid through cryptocurrency for your labor, and I think that's where the potential actually is," said Tankha. "It opens up a whole new economy for Cubans to participate in."
The resolution itself — while a promising sign for Cubans keen to participate in the world economy via bitcoin rails — is hardly a warm embrace of all things crypto. The text includes a healthy dose of skepticism, such as a disclaimer warning citizens about the risks of virtual assets and the ancillary service providers, which the government says operate at the "margins of the banking and financial system."
"Regulators around the world, from communist Cuba's central bank to the SEC, are trying to come to grips with the cryptocurrency industry. This implies that crypto is a global phenomenon and regulators have decided that it's here to stay and worth engaging with," said Sobrado.----

Daniel Van Boom is a Senior Writer based in Sydney, Australia. Daniel Van Boom covers global tech issues, culture, video games and much more. Daniel Van Boom loves speaking about himself in the third person.
He'd made thousands of dollars on a single trade the night before, and was feeling lucky. But Adam wasn't trading on the NASDAQ, pumping GameStop stocks ( ) or investing in a startup. He was about to sink $2,500 into a cryptocurrency ( ) called DeTrade.
It seemed safe. Adam had investigated the coin's development team on LinkedIn, and watched a video of its CEO laying out a roadmap for the coin's future. A newswire piece published on Yahoo touted DeTrade's technology ( ) as advanced enough to disrupt cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is very much back in the zeitgeist. On Tuesday, ahead of CoinDesk's listing on the NASDAQ, it reached an all-time-high of over $63,000, exploding almost 10-times in value compared to the same date last year. But while for many people Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency, it's not what crypto traders like Adam are interested in. Beneath Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-best-known currency, is a strange underworld of different cryptocurrencies.
Called altcoins or, sometimes, "shitcoins," these are essentially penny-stock cryptocurrencies. And they're crazy. Bitcoin tripled its value recently, but many altcoins explode 30, 40 or 50 times over within days. The most famous is Dogecoin, which recently shot up past 10 cents thanks to a potent combination of Reddit and Elon Musk ( ) , but there are thousands of altcoins, forming an Indiana Jones-esque Cave of Crypto Wonders. The spoils can be life-changing, but there are traps around each corner. Fortunes can be made and lost in seconds. Cons and fraudsters are everywhere, with traders vulnerable to scams at each step of the process.
Case in point: Adam's foray into DeTrade. The touted technology behind it wasn't real. Nothing about the project was. The LinkedIn profiles were fake, and the video of its CEO was a deepfake created with AI. It was a scam. Those behind it, operating in the unregulated world of crypto, vanished. Adam lost his $2,500, but he got off easy. In total, those behind the scam took in around $2 million.
Adam got into cryptocurrency last September. When we spoke, it felt like he'd crammed years of trading into two months. He put in $4,000 and lost it in days. Then he turned $3,000 into $90,000. After withdrawing a third of that and then losing just over another third, he now had around $20,000 in crypto.
Adam had seen some tempestuous trading in the weeks prior to DeTrade. One person managed to flip $2,000 into over $40,000 on two different occasions, but lost it all to scams both times. Another put $150 in a coin and doubled his money in 15 minutes. Decent result, but his $150 would've turned into $28,000 if he'd waited only one more day. He met people in Telegram groups, and was able to track their trades using apps that follow a user's wallet -- a common practice within cryptocurrency circles.
Late 2020 saw Bitcoin explode. Bitcoin nearly tripled in price, from $15,000 to over $40,000, in two months. If you invested $1,000 in early November, you could have taken out $2,600 in early February. It's now at over $60,000.
Investing in a stock means ascertaining its value -- based on factors like competition, risks and, above all, profit generation -- and then putting money into ones that are undervalued. If other investors follow you, the stock rises, giving you an opportunity to take profit.
Speculation is naturally part of this: The Dot-com Bubble was all about pouring money into "pre-profit" companies in the hopes they'd make money someday. Cryptocurrency, however, takes speculation into the stratosphere. For the most part, cryptocurrency is pure speculation. People are investing in technology that produces nothing, and as yet has little or no practical application. As I write this, a coin called Meme is selling for over $2,000. That's a little under 15 times the price of an Apple ( ) share. Doge, a coin marketed after the internet slang for "dog," doubled in value in January after a pornstar tweeted about it ( ). After the price settled, it then rocketed once more when Reddit wanted to make it the GameStop of cryptocurrency ( ).
David Gerard is one such skeptic. He became interested in Bitcoin in 2013, when it first hit $1,000, and has since written two books on cryptocurrency. His most recent focuses on Libra ( ) , Facebook's ill-fated attempt at digital currency.
"The driving force of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is nothing to do with technology," he told me during a Skype call. "It's all about the chance that people might get rich for free. All of this is about the psychology of get-rich-quick schemes."
After launching at around $8 in August, the obscure Meme coin briefly reached a valuation of over $1,750 in September. If, with fantastic luck, you invested $1,000 at $8 and sold at $1,750, you'd be up $217,000. This is the allure of "shitcoins."
That's no exaggeration. Cryptocurrencies are mined using powerful computers, and many enterprising types put together farms of computers used solely for the purpose of mining Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin is responsible for more energy consumption than Switzerland ( ).
This is precisely what makes them so fascinating. Seemingly, all they can do is get internet punters to bet on their success. But this enables average people to become rich. That Meme coin I mentioned before? It was listed at just over $1 and hit a high of over $4,000 in March.
He's gained renown in some Telegram groups over the past few months thanks to a "$2K to $1M" challenge, where he endeavored to see how quickly, and with how few trades, he could turn the first number into the second. In cryptocurrency, you can follow someone's portfolio if you have their wallet number, so the community was able to watch this challenge play out in real time.
Within two months, that $2,000 had grown to over $2 million. Much of that money was made off one trade: He chucked $50,000 into a project which, in the space of around a week, magnified 35 times in value, netting him $1.75 million. After passing $2 million, he cashed out.
Like Adam, Crypto Spider has no background in finance or trading. He lists college courses in game theory, basic algorithmics and some economics as useful to his crypto exploits -- but in essence he's a self-taught amateur. He declined to tell me his specific age, only that he was "20ish" when he first got into cryptocurrency in 2017.
He admits he was attracted by the "pretty numbers," by seeing coins magnify in value 30, 40 and 50 times within a short period. He was enthusiastic enough to start a university club around cryptocurrencies, and how they'd be used in the future.
Crypto Spider says cryptocurrency will play a "major part in the future of finance," and speaks with the passion of a believer. He breathlessly transitions from how cryptocurrency is a part of the internet's evolution to the possible use cases of blockchain ( ) , the technology behind Bitcoin, in the next 10 years. But despite his enthusiasm, I couldn't help but notice how chunks of what he said echoed Gerard.
Gerard calls the cryptocurrency community a pool of scammers. Spider notes that people often invest in altcoins they know don't have a function, because there's enough hype around the project to make money. "It's a bubble," he said, "we're literally swapping money from each other. I somehow was able to game all the other people."
Spider says his performance is 60% luck. He first approached cryptocurrnecy trading with the mentality of, "I'm young, I'm dumb, I can lose all my money and it'll be OK." High risk, high reward, a fair attitude.
Take OneCoin, a company that, through a presale for a cryptocurrency that didn't exist, stole $4 billion from people around the world before its founder disappeared ( ). Then there's BitConnect, a coin that reached a $2.6 billion valuation by promising a 1% return on investment every day. It was eventually designated a Ponzi scheme by various authorities around the globe, causing it to lose 96% of its value before getting shut down months later.
Those are two of the biggest instances of crypto-fraud. But millions of dollars are scammed from cryptocurrency markets every day in less dramatic ways. Coins are suddenly discontinued, with owners taking all the money with them in what the community calls "rug pulls." Some have investment contracts, ignored like terms-of-service agreements, that prohibit you from taking your money out of a project. Other times, entire cryptocurrency exchanges -- which sell coins like a stock exchange sells stocks -- vanish.
"I think I've been scammed over 100 times," Crypto Spider said, adding that he lost $250,000 through fraud in December. "Who knows who creates these projects. A lot of people are taking on pseudonyms, because they're almost all money grabs."
But the deepfake used to scam $2 million adds a new vector. Coming into wider use in recent years, deepfakes are mostly used for pornographic purposes ( ) , but as the DeTrade scam shows, deepfakes can also be used in financial scams.
OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova at an event for the "revolutionary" cryptocurrency. Ignatova disappeared around the time OneCoin was discovered to be a fraud: The cryptocurrency the company sold didn't actually exist. It's reported to have scammed over $4 billion from people around the world. Ignatova has yet to be found.
Deepfake technology "is being democratized, and that may not be a good thing," said Julie Inman-Grant. Now commissioner of the Australian government's eSafety Commission, Inman-Grant formerly led public policy teams at Microsoft ( ) , Adobe ( ) and Twitter.
"This kind of takes the art out of social engineering," she explained, referring to the techniques usually used by scammers to get you to click a fraudulent link or hand over credit card details. "If they're delivering a video of someone you respect and you really have no way of telling by the naked eye or ear if it's fake or not, the potential for misuse could be devastating."
Ironically, it's blockchain, the behind-the-scenes technology, that could be the solution to the burgeoning deepfake problem. In cryptocurrency, the blockchain is an unalterable ledger that tracks every transaction. Once it's on the ledger, it can't be altered. That same technology can be used to track anything -- like the creation and distribution of a video, from studio to iPhone ( ) screen. There are already startups working toward this, like Truepic ( ).
When Bitcoin hit $40,000 in December, before its Tesla-induced all-time-high, it was confirmation to enthusiasts that cryptocurrency is the future. For skeptics, a higher peak just means a more precipitous fall.
"I think they'll become increasingly regulated and less and less interesting," Gerard said of cryptocurrency. That means less of the "pretty numbers" Crypto Spider was attracted to, but hopefully fewer scams.
For Adam, DeTrade actually had a happy ending. One aggrieved victim of the scam analyzed the metadata of the deepfake, which he used to track down the perpetrators. After some naming and shaming across Telegram, the money was returned.----




https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/what-is-ethereum.html

Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the task in parallel to ensure it is done correctly. Generally the tasks involve money.
Mr. Buterin says he chose the name because it refers to “the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.” He announced Ethereum in late 2013, but it didn’t go into operation until 2015.
Mr. Buterin was a Bitcoin aficionado, and he was inspired by its success. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions.
The shared records of the Ethereum network — of every transaction and computation it has ever performed — are known as a blockchain, just as the shared records of all Bitcoin transactions are known as a blockchain. But Ethereum’s blockchain database is totally independent of Bitcoin’s blockchain.
Let’s say two companies want to conduct a complicated financial transaction, like settling a stock option. Neither company trusts the other company to conduct the transaction on its computers. Both companies could hire a third party, like a stock exchange, to conduct the transaction, which is what they generally do today.
But that forces them to trust that third company and to pay that company fees. With Ethereum, they can conduct the transaction on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records, ideally saving on fees.
As this example suggests, Ethereum has proved attractive to financial companies that have to complete lots of complicated financial transactions with competitors they don’t trust. Many banks are looking at how Ethereum could be used as a central operating system for various trading markets, replacing today’s exchanges and middlemen. JPMorgan Chase has even created its own version of Ethereum, known as Quorum.
*Bitcoin.* A Bitcoin ( ) is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved.
*Blockchain.* A blockchain ( ) is a database maintained communally, that reliably stores digital information ( ). The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored, but non-currency-based companies and governments are also trying to use blockchain technology to store their data.
*Cryptocurrencies.* Since Bitcoin was first conceived in 2008 ( ) , thousands of other virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies ( ) , have been developed. Among them are Ether ( ) , Dogecoin ( ) and Tether ( ).
*Coinbase.* The first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange, Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies ( ) , including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee.
*Crypto finance.* The development of cryptocurrencies spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, known as Decentralized Finance, or DeFi ( ) , allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory, including lending and borrowing.
*NFTs.* A “nonfungible token,” or NFT, is an asset verified using blockchain technology ( ) , in which a network of computers records transactions and gives buyers proof of authenticity and ownership. NFTs make digital artworks ( ) unique, and therefore sellable.
Dozens of large companies around the world came together this year to create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance ( ). The group is working to develop versions of the Ethereum software that are battle tested enough to be used in a corporate setting.
The versions of the Ethereum software that companies are building will most likely be used to set up private networks that would be totally separate from the public Ethereum network and that would not use the Ether currency. Some people, though, are betting that these private networks will eventually be plugged back into the public network.
Just as with Bitcoin, you can buy Ether from people who already own them on virtual currency exchanges. Most large countries have exchanges where a variety of virtual currencies can be bought with the local currency.----

WHEN the Honduran police came to evict her in 2009 Mariana Catalina Izaguirre had lived in her lowly house for three decades. Unlike many of her neighbours in Tegucigalpa, the country’s capital, she even had an official title to the land on which it stood. But the records at the country’s Property Institute showed another person registered as its owner, too—and that person convinced a judge to sign an eviction order. By the time the legal confusion was finally sorted out, Ms Izaguirre’s house had been demolished.
Such problems seem worlds away from bitcoin, a currency based on clever cryptography which has a devoted following among mostly well-off, often anti-government and sometimes criminal geeks. But the cryptographic technology that underlies bitcoin, called the “blockchain”, has applications well beyond cash and currency. It offers a way for people who do not know or trust each other to create a record of who owns what that will compel the assent of everyone concerned. It is a way of making and preserving truths.
That is why politicians seeking to clean up the Property Institute in Honduras have asked Factom, an American startup, to provide a prototype of a blockchain-based land registry. Interest in the idea has also been expressed in Greece, which has no proper land registry and where only 7% of the territory is adequately mapped.
Other applications for blockchain and similar “distributed ledgers” range from thwarting diamond thieves to streamlining stockmarkets: the NASDAQ exchange will soon start using a blockchain-based system to record trades in privately held companies. The Bank of England, not known for technological flights of fancy, seems electrified: distributed ledgers, it concluded in a research note late last year, are a “significant innovation” that could have “far-reaching implications” in the financial industry.
The politically minded see the blockchain reaching further than that. When co-operatives and left-wingers gathered for this year’s OuiShare Fest in Paris to discuss ways that grass-roots organisations could undermine giant repositories of data like Facebook, the blockchain made it into almost every speech. Libertarians dream of a world where more and more state regulations are replaced with private contracts between individuals—contracts which blockchain-based programming would make self-enforcing.
The blockchain began life in the mind of Satoshi Nakamoto, the brilliant, pseudonymous and so far unidentified creator of bitcoin—a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”, as he put it in a paper published in 2008. To work as cash, bitcoin had to be able to change hands without being diverted into the wrong account and to be incapable of being spent twice by the same person. To fulfil Mr Nakamoto’s dream of a decentralised system the avoidance of such abuses had to be achieved without recourse to any trusted third party, such as the banks which stand behind conventional payment systems.
It is the blockchain that replaces this trusted third party. A database that contains the payment history of every bitcoin in circulation, the blockchain provides proof of who owns what at any given juncture. This distributed ledger is replicated on thousands of computers—bitcoin’s “nodes”—around the world and is publicly available. But for all its openness it is also trustworthy and secure. This is guaranteed by the mixture of mathematical subtlety and computational brute force built into its “consensus mechanism”—the process by which the nodes agree on how to update the blockchain in the light of bitcoin transfers from one person to another.
Let us say that Alice wants to pay Bob for services rendered. Both have bitcoin “wallets”—software which accesses the blockchain rather as a browser accesses the web, but does not identify the user to the system. The transaction starts with Alice’s wallet proposing that the blockchain be changed so as to show Alice’s wallet a little emptier and Bob’s a little fuller.
The network goes through a number of steps to confirm this change. As the proposal propagates over the network the various nodes check, by inspecting the ledger, whether Alice actually has the bitcoin she now wants to spend. If everything looks kosher, specialised nodes called miners will bundle Alice’s proposal with other similarly reputable transactions to create a new block for the blockchain.
This entails repeatedly feeding the data through a cryptographic “hash” function which boils the block down into a string of digits of a given length (see diagram). Like a lot of cryptography, this hashing is a one-way street. It is easy to go from the data to their hash; impossible to go from the hash back to the data. But though the hash does not contain the data, it is still unique to them. Change what goes into the block in any way—alter a transaction by a single digit—and the hash would be different.
That hash is put, along with some other data, into the header of the proposed block. This header then becomes the basis for an exacting mathematical puzzle which involves using the hash function yet again. This puzzle can only be solved by trial and error. Across the network, miners grind through trillions and trillions of possibilities looking for the answer. When a miner finally comes up with a solution other nodes quickly check it (that’s the one-way street again: solving is hard but checking is easy), and each node that confirms the solution updates the blockchain accordingly. The hash of the header becomes the new block’s identifying string, and that block is now part of the ledger. Alice’s payment to Bob, and all the other transactions the block contains, are confirmed.
This puzzle stage introduces three things that add hugely to bitcoin’s security. One is chance. You cannot predict which miner will solve a puzzle, and so you cannot predict who will get to update the blockchain at any given time, except in so far as it has to be one of the hard working miners, not some random interloper. This makes cheating hard.
The second addition is history. Each new header contains a hash of the previous block’s header, which in turn contains a hash of the header before that, and so on and so on all the way back to the beginning. It is this concatenation that makes the blocks into a chain. Starting from all the data in the ledger it is trivial to reproduce the header for the latest block. Make a change anywhere, though—even back in one of the earliest blocks—and that changed block’s header will come out different. This means that so will the next block’s, and all the subsequent ones. The ledger will no longer match the latest block’s identifier, and will be rejected.
Is there a way round this? Imagine that Alice changes her mind about paying Bob and tries to rewrite history so that her bitcoin stays in her wallet. If she were a competent miner she could solve the requisite puzzle and produce a new version of the blockchain. But in the time it took her to do so, the rest of the network would have lengthened the original blockchain. And nodes always work on the longest version of the blockchain there is. This rule stops the occasions when two miners find the solution almost simultaneously from causing anything more than a temporary fork in the chain. It also stops cheating. To force the system to accept her new version Alice would need to lengthen it faster than the rest of the system was lengthening the original. Short of controlling more than half the computers—known in the jargon as a “51% attack”—that should not be possible.
Leaving aside the difficulties of trying to subvert the network, there is a deeper question: why bother to be part of it at all? Because the third thing the puzzle-solving step adds is an incentive. Forging a new block creates new bitcoin. The winning miner earns 25 bitcoin, worth about $7,500 at current prices.
All this cleverness does not, in itself, make bitcoin a particularly attractive currency. Its value is unstable and unpredictable (see chart), and the total amount in circulation is deliberately limited. But the blockchain mechanism works very well. According to blockchain.info, a website that tracks such things, on an average day more than 120,000 transactions are added to the blockchain, representing about $75m exchanged. There are now 380,000 blocks; the ledger weighs in at nearly 45 gigabytes.
Most of the data in the blockchain are about bitcoin. But they do not have to be. Mr Nakamoto has built what geeks call an “open platform”—a distributed system the workings of which are open to examination and elaboration. The paragon of such platforms is the internet itself; other examples include operating systems like Android or Windows. Applications that depend on basic features of the blockchain can thus be developed without asking anybody for permission or paying anyone for the privilege. “The internet finally has a public data base,” says Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm which has financed several bitcoin start-ups, including Coinbase, which provides wallets, and 21, which makes bitcoin-mining hardware for the masses.
For now blockchain-based offerings fall in three buckets. The first takes advantage of the fact that any type of asset can be transferred using the blockchain. One of the startups betting on this idea is Colu. It has developed a mechanism to “dye” very small bitcoin transactions (called “bitcoin dust”) by adding extra data to them so that they can represent bonds, shares or units of precious metals.
Protecting land titles is an example of the second bucket: applications that use the blockchain as a truth machine. Bitcoin transactions can be combined with snippets of additional information which then also become embedded in the ledger. It can thus be a registry of anything worth tracking closely. Everledger uses the blockchain to protect luxury goods; for example it will stick on to the blockchain data about a stone’s distinguishing attributes, providing unchallengeable proof of its identity should it be stolen. Onename stores personal information in a way that is meant to do away with the need for passwords; CoinSpark acts as a notary. Note, though, that for these applications, unlike for pure bitcoin transactions, a certain amount of trust is required; you have to believe the intermediary will store the data accurately.
It is the third bucket that contains the most ambitious applications: “smart contracts” that execute themselves automatically under the right circumstances. Bitcoin can be “programmed” so that it only becomes available under certain conditions. One use of this ability is to defer the payment miners get for solving a puzzle until 99 more blocks have been added—which provides another incentive to keep the blockchain in good shape.
Lighthouse, a project started by Mike Hearn, one of bitcoin’s leading programmers, is a decentralised crowdfunding service that uses these principles. If enough money is pledged to a project it all goes through; if the target is never reached, none does. Mr Hearn says his scheme will both be cheaper than non-bitcoin competitors and also more independent, as governments will be unable to pull the plug on a project they don’t like.
The advent of distributed ledgers opens up an “entirely new quadrant of possibilities”, in the words of Albert Wenger of USV, a New York venture firm that has invested in startups such as OpenBazaar, a middleman-free peer-to-peer marketplace. But for all that the blockchain is open and exciting, sceptics argue that its security may yet be fallible and its procedures may not scale. What works for bitcoin and a few niche applications may be unable to support thousands of different services with millions of users.
Though Mr Nakamoto’s subtle design has so far proved impregnable, academic researchers have identified tactics that might allow a sneaky and well financed miner to compromise the block chain without direct control of 51% of it. And getting control of an appreciable fraction of the network’s resources looks less unlikely than it used to. Once the purview of hobbyists, bitcoin mining is now dominated by large “pools”, in which small miners share their efforts and rewards, and the operators of big data centres, many based in areas of China, such as Inner Mongolia, where electricity is cheap.
Another worry is the impact on the environment. With no other way to establish the bona fides of miners, the bitcoin architecture forces them to do a lot of hard computing; this “proof of work”, without which there can be no reward, insures that all concerned have skin in the game. But it adds up to a lot of otherwise pointless computing. According to blockchain.info the network’s miners are now trying 450 thousand trillion solutions per second. And every calculation takes energy.
Because miners keep details of their hardware secret, nobody really knows how much power the network consumes. If everyone were using the most efficient hardware, its annual electricity usage might be about two terawatt-hours—a bit more than the amount used by the 150,000 inhabitants of King’s County in California’s Central Valley. Make really pessimistic assumptions about the miners’ efficiency, though, and you can get the figure up to 40 terawatt-hours, almost two-thirds of what the 10m people in Los Angeles County get through. That surely overstates the problem; still, the more widely people use bitcoin, the worse the waste could get.
Yet for all this profligacy bitcoin remains limited. Because Mr Nakamoto decided to cap the size of a block at one megabyte, or about 1,400 transactions, it can handle only around seven transactions per second, compared to the 1,736 a second Visa handles in America. Blocks could be made bigger; but bigger blocks would take longer to propagate through the network, worsening the risks of forking.
Earlier platforms have surmounted similar problems. When millions went online after the invention of the web browser in the 1990s pundits predicted the internet would grind to a standstill: eppur si muove. Similarly, the bitcoin system is not standing still. Specialised mining computers can be very energy efficient, and less energy-hungry alternatives to the proof-of-work mechanism have been proposed. Developers are also working on an add-on called “Lightning” which would handle large numbers of smaller transactions outside the blockchain. Faster connections will let bigger blocks propagate as quickly as small ones used to.
The problem is not so much a lack of fixes. It is that the network’s “bitcoin improvement process” makes it hard to choose one. Change requires community-wide agreement, and these are not people to whom consensus comes easily. Consider the civil war being waged over the size of blocks. One camp frets that quickly increasing the block size will lead to further concentration in the mining industry and turn bitcoin into more of a conventional payment processor. The other side argues that the system could crash as early as next year if nothing is done, with transactions taking hours.
Mr Hearn and Gavin Andresen, another bitcoin grandee, are leaders of the big-block camp. They have called on mining firms to install a new version of bitcoin which supports a much bigger block size. Some miners who do, though, appear to be suffering cyber-attacks. And in what seems a concerted effort to show the need for, or the dangers of, such an upgrade, the system is being driven to its limits by vast numbers of tiny transactions.
This has all given new momentum to efforts to build an alternative to the bitcoin blockchain, one that might be optimised for the storing of distributed ledgers rather than for the running of a cryptocurrency. MultiChain, a build-your-own-blockchain platform offered by Coin Sciences, another startup, demonstrates what is possible. As well as offering the wherewithal to build a public blockchain like bitcoin’s, it can also be used to build private chains open only to vetted users. If all the users start off trusted the need for mining and proof-of-work is reduced or eliminated, and a currency attached to the ledger becomes an optional extra.
The first industry to adopt such sons of blockchain may well be the one whose failings originally inspired Mr Nakamoto: finance. In recent months there has been a rush of bankerly enthusiasm for private blockchains as a way of keeping tamper-proof ledgers. One of the reasons, irony of ironies, is that this technology born of anti-government libertarianism could make it easier for the banks to comply with regulatory requirements on knowing their customers and anti-money-laundering rules. But there is a deeper appeal.
Industrial historians point out that new powers often become available long before the processes that best use them are developed. When electric motors were first developed they were deployed like the big hulking steam engines that came before them. It took decades for manufacturers to see that lots of decentralised electric motors could reorganise every aspect of the way they made things. In its report on digital currencies, the Bank of England sees something similar afoot in the financial sector. Thanks to cheap computing financial firms have digitised their inner workings; but they have not yet changed their organisations to match. Payment systems are mostly still centralised: transfers are cleared through the central bank. When financial firms do business with each other, the hard work of synchronising their internal ledgers can take several days, which ties up capital and increases risk.
Distributed ledgers that settle transactions in minutes or seconds could go a long way to solving such problems and fulfilling the greater promise of digitised banking. They could also save banks a lot of money: according to Santander, a bank, by 2022 such ledgers could cut the industry’s bills by up to $20 billion a year. Vendors still need to prove that they could deal with the far-higher-than-bitcoin transaction rates that would be involved; but big banks are already pushing for standards to shape the emerging technology. One of them, UBS, has proposed the creation of a standard “settlement coin”. The first order of business for R3 CEV, a blockchain startup in which UBS has invested alongside Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and 22 other banks, is to develop a standardised architecture for private ledgers.
The banks’ problems are not unique. All sorts of companies and public bodies suffer from hard-to-maintain and often incompatible databases and the high transaction costs of getting them to talk to each other. This is the problem Ethereum, arguably the most ambitious distributed-ledger project, wants to solve. The brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, a 21-year-old Canadian programming prodigy, Ethereum’s distributed ledger can deal with more data than bitcoin’s can. And it comes with a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level. Such cleverness, Mr Buterin hopes, will allow the formation of “decentralised autonomous organisations”—virtual companies that are basically just sets of rules running on Ethereum’s blockchain.
One of the areas where such ideas could have radical effects is in the “internet of things”—a network of billions of previously mute everyday objects such as fridges, doorstops and lawn sprinklers. A recent report from IBM entitled “Device Democracy” argues that it would be impossible to keep track of and manage these billions of devices centrally, and unwise to to try; such attempts would make them vulnerable to hacking attacks and government surveillance. Distributed registers seem a good alternative.
The sort of programmability Ethereum offers does not just allow people’s property to be tracked and registered. It allows it to be used in new sorts of ways. Thus a car-key embedded in the Ethereum blockchain could be sold or rented out in all manner of rule-based ways, enabling new peer-to-peer schemes for renting or sharing cars. Further out, some talk of using the technology to make by-then-self-driving cars self-owning, to boot. Such vehicles could stash away some of the digital money they make from renting out their keys to pay for fuel, repairs and parking spaces, all according to preprogrammed rules.
Unsurprisingly, some think such schemes overly ambitious. Ethereum’s first (“genesis”) block was only mined in August and, though there is a little ecosystem of start-ups clustered around it, Mr Buterin admitted in a recent blog post that it is somewhat short of cash. But the details of which particular blockchains end up flourishing matter much less than the broad enthusiasm for distributed ledgers that is leading both start-ups and giant incumbents to examine their potential. Despite society’s inexhaustible ability to laugh at accountants, the workings of ledgers really do matter.
Today’s world is deeply dependent on double-entry book-keeping. Its standardised system of recording debits and credits is central to any attempt to understand a company’s financial position. Whether modern capitalism absolutely required such book-keeping in order to develop, as Werner Sombart, a German sociologist, claimed in the early 20th century, is open to question. Though the system began among the merchants of renaissance Italy, which offers an interesting coincidence of timing, it spread round the world much more slowly than capitalism did, becoming widely used only in the late 19th century. But there is no question that the technique is of fundamental importance not just as a record of what a company does, but as a way of defining what one can be.
Ledgers that no longer need to be maintained by a company—or a government—may in time spur new changes in how companies and governments work, in what is expected of them and in what can be done without them. A realisation that systems without centralised record-keeping can be just as trustworthy as those that have them may bring radical change.
Such ideas can expect some eye-rolling—blockchains are still a novelty applicable only in a few niches, and the doubts as to how far they can spread and scale up may prove well founded. They can also expect resistance. Some of bitcoin’s critics have always seen it as the latest techy attempt to spread a “Californian ideology” which promises salvation through technology-induced decentralisation while ignoring and obfuscating the realities of power—and happily concentrating vast wealth in the hands of an elite. The idea of making trust a matter of coding, rather than of democratic politics, legitimacy and accountability, is not necessarily an appealing or empowering one.
At the same time, a world with record-keeping mathematically immune to manipulation would have many benefits. Evicted Ms Izaguirre would be better off; so would many others in many other settings. If blockchains have a fundamental paradox, it is this: by offering a way of setting the past and present in cryptographic stone, they could make the future a very different place.----

Many Bitcoin enthusiasts expect the U.S. government will take steps towards regulating the digital currency. Whether this regulation will threaten or legitimize the currency is still an open question.
Leaving no coin, metal, or commodity unturned, retiring Rep. Ron Paul made a final push on one of his signature issues on Thursday, seeking stronger ground for the U.S. to implement a parallel currency in lieu of the U.S. dollar.
There are few topics where so much intellectual capital has been spent on an issue of so little practical value as the prospects for either a partial or total return to the gold standard. For that reason, the issue tends to be discussed and debated among a handful of loyal advocates or opponents. But perhaps it is time for bankers to pay closer attention.
Peter is also a software developer experienced in the online payments industry and will present at the Bitcoin 2013: The Future of Payments ( ) conference in San Jose in May. His 2012 master's thesis at Vienna University of Economics and Business was entitled Economics of Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin an Alternative to Fiat Currencies and Gold? ( ) He's an abstract thinker, but the implications of his work are tantalizing: that digital money like Bitcoin opens up possibilities for banking without central planners or a lender of last resort, where interest rates and reserve requirements are driven purely by the market.
The debate between the full reserve bankers and the fractional reserve bankers is an old one and it has been explored ( ) in depth by the Austrian school of economics ( ). More recently, the debate has been broadened to include the dynamics of introducing the bitcoin cryptocurrency, which is the functional equivalent of digital gold, since its supply is predictable and fixed. (There are currently 10.9 million bitcoins in circulation with a total fixed supply ( ) of 21 million expected to be mined before 2140, 99% of them by the year 2032.) The Austrian school economist Michael Suede ( ) and the technologist Eli Gothill ( ) have speculated that fractional reserve banking can indeed appear within a bitcoin monetary environment. This is where we join up with Peter.
PETER ŠURDA: First of all, I would like to separate fractional reserve banking and credit expansion. On one hand, there are ways of increasing the money supply, in the broader sense, which do not require fractional reserve banking or changes in the monetary base such as a system based on the principle of mutual credit like LETS [ local exchange trading systems ( ) ], or a fiat currency that uses bitcoin as reserves (i.e. they are not claims in the sense that Ludwig von Mises ( ) uses them, but they act as full substitutes). From the opposite direction, fractional reserve banking does not necessarily lead to credit expansion.
I agree with the full reservists that credit expansion has the effects described by the Austrian Business Cycle Theory ( ). However, I agree with the free bankers ( ) that fractional reserve banking is not necessarily a violation of property rights and other ways of increasing the money supply also are not necessarily a violation of property rights.
So I think that the economic and legal analysis are two separate issues and need to be addressed separately. I avoided the legal analysis in my thesis and concentrated on Austrian Business Cycle Theory and policy issues, but in an earlier draft I have several pages about legal aspects too, and I discussed the topic with [the legal theorist] Stephan Kinsella ( ).
PETER ŠURDA: Austrians have made arguments in the past that lead to the conclusion that fractional reserve banking does not necessarily lead to credit expansion, even though they never explicitly formulated it this way and might not have realized the connection. The reason is that if credit instruments do not decrease transaction costs over the monetary base, they are unlikely to act as a part of the money supply. Bitcoin shows that this is not only a hypothetical but empirically possible to implement. With Bitcoin, it is much less likely that credit expansion will occur.
In other words, we need to separate two things. Why do people want to hold fractional reserve banking instruments, which may include the interest payments as one of the reasons, and why do people want to use fractional reserve banking instruments as a medium of exchange which, I argue, requires that the fractional reserve banking instruments decrease transaction costs. That they historically manifested themselves through a common instrument is an empirical quirk and not an economic rule. The ability to loan money is beneficial. Contrary to many Austrians, I agree that maturity transformation ( ) can be beneficial, and if the loan ends up being a liquid instrument, it also can be beneficial. But if it is so liquid that it becomes a part of the money supply, that's when it has a detrimental effect on the economy.
For full reservists, Bitcoin shows that the question of fractional reserve banking is less important than they thought. Fractional reservists, on the other hand, need to think about the nature of the mechanisms equilibrating the money supply. I tried to explain the issue to [the economists] George Selgin ( ) and David Glasner ( ) in comments on their websites, but I wasn't successful in getting my point through.
PETER ŠURDA: They probably can emerge, but the more important question is whether they would be preferred to bitcoin. Only something that provides a significant improvement would be preferred. I only know two potential candidates for that: Ripple ( ) and OpenTransactions ( ).
JON MATONIS: In a bitcoin world, is fractional reserve banking only possible with offline substitutes (such as physical coins ( ) or cards ( ) , which can be traded hand-to-hand, containing the private key to a bitcoin address) or an intentional "fork" in the block chain ( ) ledger?
PETER ŠURDA: Hypothetically, the reserves can be offline and the substitute can be a clearing system like Ripple, so there are other possibilities too. But if I understand your point correctly, offline "substitutes" might have a higher chance of actually becoming full substitutes because they might have more obvious advantages.
JON MATONIS: As the recent block chain fork episode ( ) demonstrates, there is a need for offline bitcoin transactions to continue. Is this demand sufficient for a money substitute ( ) to evolve, such as offline substitutes with full or partial bitcoin backing?
PETER ŠURDA: This is primarily an empirical question, so we can't be completely sure about that. I think the probability for this is significantly lower than with the currencies that we've known historically. The end result is also path-dependent; for instance, it depends on how quickly bitcoin matures adapts to changes compared to the potential substitute.
Fractional reserve banking does not come into existence magically. It must follow economic rules. With gold and similar commodities, fractional reserve banking comes into existence for these reasons: On the demand side, there is a demand for money substitutes, because they provide something that money proper does not; and on the supply side, money substitutes carry maintenance costs for the issuer (e.g. storage of gold) and these need to be offset somehow. The issuer can charge on holding (e.g. demurrage ( ) of bank notes), transacting (e.g. check clearing), or, obviously, externalize the costs through fractional reserves. From the point of view of an individual user, fractional reserve banking appears to be the least costly alternative. So obviously fractional reserve banking wins.
Putting it together: If there is a general demand for money substitutes, this leads to fractional reserve banking. Unless it's illegal. Then it might not. Solution: Have money which does not lead to the creation of money substitutes. Bitcoin shows that at least hypothetically, this is possible. I might even go a bit further and make this statement: If on a free market money substitutes do not develop even though there is no legal or technical obstacle for them, it means that the choice of money is Pareto-optimal ( ) since no change in the monetary system leads to an increase in utility.
JON MATONIS: Does a demand for positive return on bitcoin balances lead to an environment of competitive bank lending with risk-adjusted interest rates? And will this lead to an environment of fractional reserve banking with depositors offered higher interest rates in exchange for the additional risk premium of running a fractional portfolio?
This might lead to negotiable credit instruments ( ) with maturity-mismatching ( ) or maturity transformation, depending on which economic school you use for terminology. However, I don't think this feature alone is sufficient for these instruments to be accepted as full substitutes whereas George Selgin appears to think it is. Now, whether to call such a situation "fractional reserve banking" even though no credit expansion occurs is unclear. I lean towards yes, but there could be other interpretations.
PETER ŠURDA: Using Bitcoin for loans only makes sense for those businesses that use bitcoin as a unit of account, unless, of course, you're just speculating on the market but don't actually sell any goods or services. I think this will only occur at much higher levels of liquidity or until we can be quite sure that it deserves the label "money." Until these higher levels of liquidity are reached, the price of bitcoin will probably be quite volatile, which reduces the likelihood that people use it as a unit of account.
However, there could be niche market segments that use bitcoin as a primary medium of exchange and [bitcoin] mining ( ) is the most obvious candidate. For these, the unit of account function would make sense even if the global market penetration is lower.
Assuming one of these thresholds is crossed and the money supply remains inelastic (i.e. no significant credit expansion), the interest rate of bitcoin should be a good reflection of the time preference of those market participants that use it as a unit of account. Bitcoin also makes it much easier for lending to occur in a decentralized manner, I think. Rather than a small number of "too big to fail" institutions, we should see smaller specialized teams that act as facilitators without owning the liabilities or being liable themselves.
PETER ŠURDA: I think that if money substitutes emerge, fractional reserve banking will out-compete 100% reserve banking in the market. I deal with this a bit in an earlier draft of the thesis. If they don't emerge, on the other hand, we'll have a money supply equivalent to the monetary base and debt will not cause changes in the money supply. It would be viewed as merely highly liquid credit. I don't think they can coexist for a long time assuming the same underlying money in the narrower sense, of course.

The Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and CFPB — increasingly under the leadership of Democratic appointees — are gearing up to regulate cryptocurrency, modernize the Community Reinvestment Act and give consumers more control of their personal data. Here’s a look at the policy changes they’re mulling.
The Federal Reserve's capital guidance for S corporations is hindering some community development banks' access to the Treasury's $9 billion Emergency Capital Investment Program. The Fed has offered exemptions in the past, so why isn't it doing so now?
New England Federal Credit Union, the largest financial institution headquartered in the Green Mountain State, is combining with Vermont State Employees Credit Union to create an organization with $3 billion of assets.
Community lenders may choose to stop serving small businesses rather than absorb the expense of collecting information on race and ethnicity under a proposal by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Banks flush with liquidity are likely to keep deposit yields low even as the rates they earn on loans widen, which should result in higher net interest income. One industry analyst predicts “NII to the sky.”----

Contracts, transactions, and records of them provide critical structure in our economic system, but they haven’t kept up with the world’s digital transformation. They’re like rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car.
Blockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology behind bitcoin, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions safely, permanently, and very efficiently. For instance, while the transfer of a share of stock can now take up to a week, with blockchain it could happen in seconds. Blockchain could slash the cost of transactions and eliminate intermediaries like lawyers and bankers, and that could transform the economy. But, like the adoption of more internet technologies, blockchain’s adoption will require broad coordination and will take years. In this article the authors describe the path that blockchain is likely to follow and explain how firms should think about investments in it.
Like (on which the internet was built), blockchain is a foundational technology that will require broad coordination. The level of complexity—technological, regulatory, and social—will be unprecedented.
Contracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economic, legal, and political systems. They protect assets and set organizational boundaries. They establish and verify identities and chronicle events. They govern interactions among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals. They guide managerial and social action. And yet these critical tools and the bureaucracies formed to manage them have not kept up with the economy’s digital transformation. They’re like a rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car. In a digital world, the way we regulate and maintain administrative control has to change.
Blockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. (See the sidebar “How Blockchain Works.”)
Each party on a blockchain has access to the entire database and its complete history. No single party controls the data or the information. Every party can verify the records of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary.
Every transaction and its associated value are visible to anyone with access to the system. Each node, or user, on a blockchain has a unique 30-plus-character alphanumeric address that identifies it. Users can choose to remain anonymous or provide proof of their identity to others. Transactions occur between blockchain addresses.
Once a transaction is entered in the database and the accounts are updated, the records cannot be altered, because they’re linked to every transaction record that came before them (hence the term “chain”). Various computational algorithms and approaches are deployed to ensure that the recording on the database is permanent, chronologically ordered, and available to all others on the network.
The digital nature of the ledger means that blockchain transactions can be tied to computational logic and in essence programmed. So users can set up algorithms and rules that automatically trigger transactions between nodes.
Indeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. Although we share the enthusiasm for its potential, we worry about the hype. It’s not just security issues (such as the 2014 collapse of one bitcoin exchange and the more recent hacks of others) that concern us. Our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if there’s to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers—technological, governance, organizational, and even societal—will have to fall. It would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.
True blockchain-led transformation of business and government, we believe, is still many years away. That’s because blockchain is not a “disruptive” technology, which can attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly. Blockchain is a foundational technology: It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems. But while the impact will be enormous, it will take decades for blockchain to seep into our economic and social infrastructure. The process of adoption will be gradual and steady, not sudden, as waves of technological and institutional change gain momentum. That insight and its strategic implications are what we’ll explore in this article.
Before jumping into blockchain strategy and investment, let’s reflect on what we know about technology adoption and, in particular, the transformation process typical of other foundational technologies. One of the most relevant examples is distributed computer networking technology, seen in the adoption of (transmission control protocol), which laid the groundwork for the development of the internet.
Introduced in 1972, first gained traction in a single-use case: as the basis for e-mail among the researchers on ARPAnet, the U.S. Department of Defense precursor to the commercial internet. Before telecommunications architecture was based on “circuit switching,” in which connections between two parties or machines had to be preestablished and sustained throughout an exchange. To ensure that any two nodes could communicate, telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers had invested billions in building dedicated lines.
TCP/IP turned that model on its head. The new protocol transmitted information by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets, each including address information. Once released into the network, the packets could take any route to the recipient. Smart sending and receiving nodes at the network’s edges could disassemble and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. There was no need for dedicated private lines or massive infrastructure. created an open, shared public network without any central authority or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement.
Traditional telecommunications and computing sectors looked on with skepticism. Few imagined that robust data, messaging, voice, and video connections could be established on the new architecture or that the associated system could be secure and scale up. But during the late 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of firms, such as Sun, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics, used in part to create localized private networks within organizations. To do so, they developed building blocks and tools that broadened its use beyond e-mail, gradually replacing more-traditional local network technologies and standards. As organizations adopted these building blocks and tools, they saw dramatic gains in productivity.
TCP/IP burst into broad public use with the advent of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s. New technology companies quickly emerged to provide the “plumbing”—the hardware, software, and services needed to connect to the now-public network and exchange information. Netscape commercialized browsers, web servers, and other tools and components that aided the development and adoption of internet services and applications. Sun drove the development of Java, the application-programming language. As information on the web grew exponentially, Infoseek, Excite, AltaVista, and Yahoo were born to guide users around it.
Once this basic infrastructure gained critical mass, a new generation of companies took advantage of low-cost connectivity by creating internet services that were compelling substitutes for existing businesses. CNET moved news online. Amazon offered more books for sale than any bookshop. Priceline and Expedia made it easier to buy airline tickets and brought unprecedented transparency to the process. The ability of these newcomers to get extensive reach at relatively low cost put significant pressure on traditional businesses like newspapers and brick-and-mortar retailers.
Relying on broad internet connectivity, the next wave of companies created novel, transformative applications that fundamentally changed the way businesses created and captured value. These companies were built on a new peer-to-peer architecture and generated value by coordinating distributed networks of users. Think of how eBay changed online retail through auctions, Napster changed the music industry, Skype changed telecommunications, and Google, which exploited user-generated links to provide more relevant results, changed web search.
Ultimately, it took more than 30 years for to move through all the phases—single use, localized use, substitution, and transformation—and reshape the economy. Today more than half the world’s most valuable public companies have internet-driven, platform-based business models. The very foundations of our economy have changed. Physical scale and unique intellectual property no longer confer unbeatable advantages; increasingly, the economic leaders are enterprises that act as “keystones,” proactively organizing, influencing, and coordinating widespread networks of communities, users, and organizations.
Blockchain—a peer-to-peer network that sits on top of the internet—was introduced in October 2008 as part of a proposal for bitcoin, a virtual currency system that eschewed a central authority for issuing currency, transferring ownership, and confirming transactions. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology.
The parallels between blockchain and are clear. Just as e-mail enabled bilateral messaging, bitcoin enables bilateral financial transactions. The development and maintenance of blockchain is open, distributed, and shared—just like A team of volunteers around the world maintains the core software. And just like e-mail, bitcoin first caught on with an enthusiastic but relatively small community.
TCP/IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.
Consider how business works now. Keeping ongoing records of transactions is a core function of any business. Those records track past actions and performance and guide planning for the future. They provide a view not only of how the organization works internally but also of the organization’s outside relationships. Every organization keeps its own records, and they’re private. Many organizations have no master ledger of all their activities; instead records are distributed across internal units and functions. The problem is, reconciling transactions across individual and private ledgers takes a lot of time and is prone to error.
For example, a typical stock transaction can be executed within microseconds, often without human intervention. However, the settlement—the ownership transfer of the stock—can take as long as a week. That’s because the parties have no access to each other’s ledgers and can’t automatically verify that the assets are in fact owned and can be transferred. Instead a series of intermediaries act as guarantors of assets as the record of the transaction traverses organizations and the ledgers are individually updated.
In a blockchain system, the ledger is replicated in a large number of identical databases, each hosted and maintained by an interested party. When changes are entered in one copy, all the other copies are simultaneously updated. So as transactions occur, records of the value and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all ledgers. There is no need for third-party intermediaries to verify or transfer ownership. If a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based system, it would be settled within seconds, securely and verifiably. (The infamous hacks that have hit bitcoin exchanges exposed weaknesses not in the blockchain itself but in separate systems linked to parties using the blockchain.)
If bitcoin is like early e-mail, is blockchain decades from reaching its full potential? In our view the answer is a qualified yes. We can’t predict exactly how many years the transformation will take, but we can guess which kinds of applications will gain traction first and how blockchain’s broad acceptance will eventually come about.
The adoption of foundational technologies typically happens in four phases. Each phase is defined by the novelty of the applications and the complexity of the coordination efforts needed to make them workable. Applications low in novelty and complexity gain acceptance first. Applications high in novelty and complexity take decades to evolve but can transform the economy. technology, introduced on ARPAnet in 1972, has already reached the transformation phase, but blockchain applications (in red) are in their early days.
In our analysis, history suggests that two dimensions affect how a foundational technology and its business use cases evolve. The first is novelty—the degree to which an application is new to the world. The more novel it is, the more effort will be required to ensure that users understand what problems it solves. The second dimension is complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination involved—the number and diversity of parties that need to work together to produce value with the technology. For example, a social network with just one member is of little use; a social network is worthwhile only when many of your own connections have signed on to it. Other users of the application must be brought on board to generate value for all participants. The same will be true for many blockchain applications. And, as the scale and impact of those applications increase, their adoption will require significant institutional change.
We’ve developed a framework that maps innovations against these two contextual dimensions, dividing them into quadrants. (See the exhibit “How Foundational Technologies Take Hold.”) Each quadrant represents a stage of technology development. Identifying which one a blockchain innovation falls into will help executives understand the types of challenges it presents, the level of collaboration and consensus it needs, and the legislative and regulatory efforts it will require. The map will also suggest what kind of processes and infrastructure must be established to facilitate the innovation’s adoption. Managers can use it to assess the state of blockchain development in any industry, as well as to evaluate strategic investments in their own blockchain capabilities.
In the first quadrant are low-novelty and low-coordination applications that create better, less costly, highly focused solutions. E-mail, a cheap alternative to phone calls, faxes, and snail mail, was a single-use application for (even though its value rose with the number of users). Bitcoin, too, falls into this quadrant. Even in its early days, bitcoin offered immediate value to the few people who used it simply as an alternative payment method. (You can think of it as a complex e-mail that transfers not just information but also actual value.) At the end of 2016 the value of bitcoin transactions was expected to hit $92 billion. That’s still a rounding error compared with the $411 trillion in total global payments, but bitcoin is growing fast and increasingly important in contexts such as instant payments and foreign currency and asset trading, where the present financial system has limitations.
The second quadrant comprises innovations that are relatively high in novelty but need only a limited number of users to create immediate value, so it’s still relatively easy to promote their adoption. If blockchain follows the path network technologies took in business, we can expect blockchain innovations to build on single-use applications to create local private networks on which multiple organizations are connected through a distributed ledger.
Much of the initial private blockchain-based development is taking place in the financial services sector, often within small networks of firms, so the coordination requirements are relatively modest. Nasdaq is working with Chain.com, one of many blockchain infrastructure providers, to offer technology for processing and validating financial transactions. Bank of America, JPMorgan, the New York Stock Exchange, Fidelity Investments, and Standard Chartered are testing blockchain technology as a replacement for paper-based and manual transaction processing in such areas as trade finance, foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, and securities settlement. The Bank of Canada is testing a digital currency called CAD-coin for interbank transfers. We anticipate a proliferation of private blockchains that serve specific purposes for various industries.
The third quadrant contains applications that are relatively low in novelty because they build on existing single-use and localized applications, but are high in coordination needs because they involve broader and increasingly public uses. These innovations aim to replace entire ways of doing business. They face high barriers to adoption, however; not only do they require more coordination but the processes they hope to replace may be full-blown and deeply embedded within organizations and institutions. Examples of substitutes include cryptocurrencies—new, fully formed currency systems that have grown out of the simple bitcoin payment technology. The critical difference is that a cryptocurrency requires every party that does monetary transactions to adopt it, challenging governments and institutions that have long handled and overseen such transactions. Consumers also have to change their behavior and understand how to implement the new functional capability of the cryptocurrency.
A recent experiment at MIT highlights the challenges ahead for digital currency systems. In 2014 the MIT Bitcoin Club provided each of MIT’s 4,494 undergraduates with $100 in bitcoin. Interestingly, 30% of the students did not even sign up for the free money, and 20% of the sign-ups converted the bitcoin to cash within a few weeks. Even the technically savvy had a tough time understanding how or where to use bitcoin.
One of the most ambitious substitute blockchain applications is Stellar, a nonprofit that aims to bring affordable financial services, including banking, micropayments, and remittances, to people who’ve never had access to them. Stellar offers its own virtual currency, lumens, and also allows users to retain on its system a range of assets, including other currencies, telephone minutes, and data credits. Stellar initially focused on Africa, particularly Nigeria, the largest economy there. It has seen significant adoption among its target population and proved its cost-effectiveness. But its future is by no means certain, because the ecosystem coordination challenges are high. Although grassroots adoption has demonstrated the viability of Stellar, to become a banking standard, it will need to influence government policy and persuade central banks and large organizations to use it. That could take years of concerted effort.
Into the last quadrant fall completely novel applications that, if successful, could change the very nature of economic, social, and political systems. They involve coordinating the activity of many actors and gaining institutional agreement on standards and processes. Their adoption will require major social, legal, and political change.
“Smart contracts” may be the most transformative blockchain application at the moment. These automate payments and the transfer of currency or other assets as negotiated conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might send a payment to a supplier as soon as a shipment is delivered. A firm could signal via blockchain that a particular good has been received—or the product could have GPS functionality, which would automatically log a location update that, in turn, triggered a payment. We’ve already seen a few early experiments with such self-executing contracts in the areas of venture funding, banking, and digital rights management.
The implications are fascinating. Firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. If contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? And what about managers? Their roles would all radically change. Before we get too excited here, though, let’s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. They cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. A tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve. And the technology challenges—especially security—are daunting.
For most, the easiest place to start is single-use applications, which minimize risk because they aren’t new and involve little coordination with third parties. One strategy is to add bitcoin as a payment mechanism. The infrastructure and market for bitcoin are already well developed, and adopting the virtual currency will force a variety of functions, including IT, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing, to build blockchain capabilities. Another low-risk approach is to use blockchain internally as a database for applications like managing physical and digital assets, recording internal transactions, and verifying identities. This may be an especially useful solution for companies struggling to reconcile multiple internal databases. Testing out single-use applications will help organizations develop the skills they need for more-advanced applications. And thanks to the emergence of cloud-based blockchain services from both start-ups and large platforms like Amazon and Microsoft, experimentation is getting easier all the time.
Localized applications are a natural next step for companies. We’re seeing a lot of investment in private blockchain networks right now, and the projects involved seem poised for real short-term impact. Financial services companies, for example, are finding that the private blockchain networks they’ve set up with a limited number of trusted counterparties can significantly reduce transaction costs.
Organizations can also tackle specific problems in transactions across boundaries with localized applications. Companies are already using blockchain to track items through complex supply chains, for instance. This is happening in the diamond industry, where gems are being traced from mines to consumers. The technology for such experiments is now available off-the-shelf.
Developing substitute applications requires careful planning, since existing solutions may be difficult to dislodge. One way to go may be to focus on replacements that won’t require end users to change their behavior much but present alternatives to expensive or unattractive solutions. To get traction, substitutes must deliver functionality as good as a traditional solution’s and must be easy for the ecosystem to absorb and adopt. First Data’s foray into blockchain-based gift cards is a good example of a well-considered substitute. Retailers that offer them to consumers can dramatically lower costs per transaction and enhance security by using blockchain to track the flows of currency within accounts—without relying on external payment processors. These new gift cards even allow transfers of balances and transaction capability between merchants via the common ledger.
Transformative applications are still far away. But it makes sense to evaluate their possibilities now and invest in developing technology that can enable them. They will be most powerful when tied to a new business model in which the logic of value creation and capture departs from existing approaches. Such business models are hard to adopt but can unlock future growth for companies.
Consider how law firms will have to change to make smart contracts viable. They’ll need to develop new expertise in software and blockchain programming. They’ll probably also have to rethink their hourly payment model and entertain the idea of charging transaction or hosting fees for contracts, to name just two possible approaches. Whatever tack they take, executives must be sure they understand and have tested the business model implications before making any switch.
Transformative scenarios will take off last, but they will also deliver enormous value. Two areas where they could have a profound impact: large-scale public identity systems for such functions as passport control, and algorithm-driven decision making in the prevention of money laundering and in complex financial transactions that involve many parties. We expect these applications won’t reach broad adoption and critical mass for at least another decade and probably more.
Transformative applications will also give rise to new platform-level players that will coordinate and govern the new ecosystems. These will be the Googles and Facebooks of the next generation. It will require patience to realize such opportunities. Though it may be premature to start making significant investments in them now, developing the required foundations for them—tools and standards—is still worthwhile.
In addition to providing a good template for blockchain’s adoption, has most likely smoothed the way for it. has become ubiquitous, and blockchain applications are being built on top of the digital data, communication, and computation infrastructure, which lowers the cost of experimentation and will allow new use cases to emerge rapidly.
With our framework, executives can figure out where to start building their organizational capabilities for blockchain today. They need to ensure that their staffs learn about blockchain, to develop company-specific applications across the quadrants we’ve identified, and to invest in blockchain infrastructure.
But given the time horizons, barriers to adoption, and sheer complexity involved in getting to levels of acceptance, executives should think carefully about the risks involved in experimenting with blockchain. Clearly, starting small is a good way to develop the know-how to think bigger. But the level of investment should depend on the context of the company and the industry. Financial services companies are already well down the road to blockchain adoption. Manufacturing is not.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency

B itcoin’s electricity usage is enormous. In November, the power consumed by the entire bitcoin network was estimated to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. Since then, its demands have only grown. It’s now on pace to use just over 42TWh of electricity in a year, placing it ahead of New Zealand and Hungary and just behind Peru, according to estimates from Digiconomist ( ). That’s commensurate with CO2 emissions of 20 megatonnes – or roughly 1m transatlantic flights.
That fact should be a grave notion to anyone who hopes for the cryptocurrency to grow further in stature and enter widespread usage. But even more alarming is that things could get much, much worse, helping to increase climate change in the process.
Burning huge amounts of electricity isn’t incidental to bitcoin: instead, it’s embedded into the innermost core of the currency, as the operation known as “mining”. In simplified terms, bitcoin mining is a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second.
Bitcoin ( ) is a 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Invented in 2008, you store your bitcoins in a digital wallet, and transactions are stored in a public ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the digital currency being double-spent.
Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions.
This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.
The exchange rate has been volatile, with some deeming it a risky investment. In January 2021 the UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers they should be prepared to lose all their money ( ) if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin.
In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. In November 2021 it hit a record high of more than $68,000 ( ) , as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.
Bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint ( ) of the system. New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins that have been "mined", the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process.
The more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. The prize? 12.5 bitcoin – still worth over $100,000 – plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analysts’ estimates is another $2,500 or so.
This is a winner-takes-all game, where the prize is guaranteed to be paid to one, and only one, miner every 10 minutes. Burning more electricity increases your chances of winning, but correspondingly decreases everyone else’s – and so they have a motivation to burn more electricity in turn.
The economic outcome of all of this is laid bare in a Credit Suisse briefing note published on Tuesday: the network as a whole will reinvest almost all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards back into its electricity consumption. (Credit Suisse’s ballpark figure assumes that 80% of the expenses of bitcoin miners are spent on electricity).
At current prices for electricity and bitcoin, the bank calculates a maximum profitable power draw of bitcoin at around 100TWh – two-and-a-half times higher than its current rate. Any higher and the miner will lose money.
But it gets worse. If bitcoin were to become the global currency its supporters hope it will, its pricewould increase. And if its price increases, so too does the amount of electricity miners can afford to burn.
Credit Suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 – five times its level as I write – would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. And at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining.
The bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying about, for two reasons: it doesn’t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used for miners. Credit Suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation and data centres, two other industries that once sparked fears they would have huge power draws.
I’m not convinced we should be so blasé. It’s true that bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but almost all its competitors use essentially the same wasteful mining system it does. If they took over pole position, it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. (One major competitor, Ethereum, has long discussed moving to a “proof-of-stake” system, which would radically change its power use for the better, but the switchover still hasn’t happened. It’s currently scheduled for mid-2018.)
Mining computers have become more power-efficient, with the latest generation of machines able to do roughly 20% more useless calculations per MWh of electricity. But in the zero-sum game of bitcoin mining, that just means a miner can afford to run more machines at the same time, leaving their power usage roughly stable.
On that point, there is good news to be had: bitcoin is down to just over $10,000 ( ) , almost half the level it was trading at a month ago. If it continues to fall, we might be able to return to worrying about more conventional sources of climate change, like the automotive industry, plane travel, and Donald Trump.----




http://www.worldoil.com/news/2018/1/26/cryptocurrency-mining-operation-launched-by-iron-bridge-resources

ICT will own and operate cryptocurrency mining data centers at Canadian oil and gas field sites, taking advantage of cheap, clean burning natural gas to generate its own electricity. As a result of this structure and the current Canadian gas price environment, ICT will benefit from some of the lowest cost power in the world.
The company expects to begin operating its pilot cryptocurrency mining facility near IBR’s oil and gas operations at Elmworth, Alberta. The company is already currently mining with equipment sourced and assembled by technology professionals who have been engaged by the company. These professionals are IT systems architects who have extensive experience assembling mining equipment and have a history of profitably mining cryptocurrencies. ICT is providing hosting services for a limited amount of equipment from third-parties, and expects this to be a growth area for the company. The company is currently mining Bitcoin and intends to maintain flexibility with regard to the type of cryptocurrency coin that gets mined going forward.
While North American natural gas prices have been weak for a number of years, the market in Western Canada has been significantly negatively impacted by strong supplies and persistent pipeline takeaway restrictions. This has lead to AECO prices that trade in the $1.50 per GJ range in the futures market. This pricing environment, combined with the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as increasingly accepted and enduring technologies, provides an opportunity for ICT to become an important infrastructure player by leveraging its sustainable power cost advantage in a safe, stable developed country.
ICT’s pilot cryptocurrency mining project will involve a very modest initial capex investment as a result of its ability to leverage existing infrastructure and excess power generation from IBR’s Elmworth hydrocarbon processing battery, fired by IBR’s clean burning natural gas production, to provide power to the mining control center. The pilot project currently has access to approximately 700 kW of very low cost power with the ability to expand that power generation capability rapidly. The company’s parent company, Iron Bridge Resources, currently produces enough natural gas to power a 45 MW facility and expects to significantly increase that gas production within the next two months when it brings on-stream additional Montney production. ICT is also in discussions with other natural gas producers to work with them on future commercial projects. As a result, the company is interested in pursuing industrial scale hosting opportunities.
Part of ICT’s strategy involves the sourcing of cryptocurrency mining rigs using processing gear that is not experiencing the high levels of demand that many rig components currently are seeing. Being located in a cold jurisdiction where power is abundantly cheap, the company is sourcing components that would be challenging to use in typical grid-connected and warmer climates.  This is expected to further reduce capital costs and could be a sustainable competitive advantage in hosting.----

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit its lowest level so far this year on Sunday. There are mixed opinions about the price of Bitcoin; the cryptocurrency is under pressure due to regulatory issues but a majority of investors and analysts see a bright future for the cryptocurrency nonetheless. However, things may not go well for the leading cryptocurrency in the short-term.
On Sunday, the price of Bitcoin hit its lowest level of $5,787 so far this year. This marked a decline of more than 70% since December 2017. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is under pressure due to regulatory uncertainty, particularly in Japan.
Todd Gordon, the founder of TradingAnalysis.com, believes that the price of Bitcoin will drop to $4000 before bouncing to more than $10,000 by 2019. Speaking with CNBC, Gordon said that the value of BTC is expected to continue declining in the short term.
Ebang Communication, a bitcoin mining chip maker in China, plans to launch an initial public offering. The company has filed an IPO application with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. A report from Reuters in May suggested that the company was looking to raise $1 billion though the public offering.
Alibaba founder and billionaire Jack Ma sees Bitcoin as a bubble. His firm Ant Financial has launched a blockchain-based money transfer service between Hong Kong and the Philippines. Ma is bearish on Bitcoin, but the billionaire is bullish on blockchain technology generally.
Ukraine says that cryptocurrencies miners won’t be needing a license to operate in the country. In a statement, the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, which is responsible for licensing administration, said that crypto miners can start their operations without a license. Ukraine is a paradise for cryptocurrencies miner. The country generates an annual revenue of more than $100 million from crypto mining industry.
South Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance has denied reports that the country is preparing to impose a 10% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency income. Last week, local media outlet Chosun reported that South Korea was considering a 10% tax on cryptocurrency profits. The publication cited a high-ranked government official.
The Canadian province of Quebec is planning to allocate 500MW of electricity to cryptocurrency mining companies. BcFocus reported that Hydro Quebec submitted a proposal to the provincial government selling of electricity to cryptocurrency miners. The electric company believes that this move would not only benefit cryptocurrency miners but would help in reducing electricity rates for customers.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have soared in value over the past year, thanks to continued interest from a range of investors. As the price of these cryptocurrencies has increased, graphics cards have also seen big price increases thanks to retail stock shortages. A range of mid- or high-end graphics cards from AMD or Nvidia are in short supply, mostly due to cryptocurrency miners buying them in bulk to build machines to mine bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.
Polygon reports ( ) that pricing for Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 should be around $380 (depending on the model), but that some cards are now being sold ( ) for more than $700 due to the stock shortages – an increase of more than 80 percent. Cryptocurrency miners use stacks of graphics cards to solve the mathematical problems need to authenticate payments on the network and create new bitcoin. There’s only a finite number of bitcoins available, and because of the way the network is designed, each new bitcoin takes more power to mine. This has led to increased demand for more powerful graphics cards to tackle multiple cryptocurrencies.
The graphics card pricing is making it a lot harder to build a gaming PC from scratch right now, especially as the stock shortages of mid-range cards like the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 also push up the prices of more capable cards. Nvidia’s GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, and AMD’s Radeon RX 570, 580, Vega 56, and Vega 64 cards have all been impacted in recent months.
Nvidia is advising its retail partners ( ) to prioritize gamers over miners, but retailers are able to generate some impressive margins at the moment so it’s unlikely that simple advice will result in real changes. Some retailers are limiting purchases so miners can’t buy stacks of cards, and Polygon reports that Micro Center is specifically offering discounts ( ) to PC gamers who are buying the cards alongside other components. Micro Center blames high demand from miners and constrained shipments from vendors for the industry-wide shortages.
It’s a problem that’s affecting pricing worldwide, not just in the US, and it seems unlikely to end unless graphics card vendors can flood the market to keep up with demand. It could put off PC gaming newcomers who are deciding between building a mid-range PC or opting for a PlayStation 4 Pro Xbox One X. Gamers have had to put up with volatile pricing of RAM over the years, and as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency pricing continues to fluctuate ( ) it’s clear that graphics cards will be the latest bottleneck in building the perfect gaming PC.----

The ongoing shortage of gaming graphics cards has kept prices for AMD’s and Nvidia’s midrange and high-end GPUs in the stratosphere, and retailers are taking steps to try to give gamers a better chance of buying the in-demand cards before cryptocurrency miners can snatch them up.
In case you’re not aware of the situation, here’s what’s going on: Cryptocurrency mining requires immense computational power, and miners figured out years ago that the chips in many high-end graphics cards are well-suited to the task. The values of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent months — a single bitcoin is currently worth well over $11,000 ( ) , although that figure is in flux and has been trending downward since a peak above $19,000 last month. This has led people to put together “mining rigs” — after buying multiple consumer graphics cards for the necessary computing power — and then try to turn a profit on their investment by mining for cryptocurrency like Ethereum.
For instance, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070’s suggested retail price is $380, but it was selling for upward of $450 last year and is now going for more than $700 ( ). Lower-end cards like the GTX 1050 and 1060 weren’t affected initially, but miners have moved on to them as the better cards have sold out, pushing up prices for the cheaper GPUs as well. And, as the value of bitcoin spiked in December, prices rose even further.
Last week, it was reported that Nvidia is suggesting that its retail partners take measures to help ensure that they can sell graphics cards to gamers ahead of miners ( ). Nvidia and AMD declined comment to Polygon, with both companies citing quiet periods — a business term referring to a waiting period prior to the release of a quarterly fiscal report.
But some retailers have told Polygon that they are indeed taking action on this front. Micro Center is taking the most exceptional measure, having implemented a policy in the past week that is specifically designed to prioritize people who are building (or have recently built) a gaming computer. The boutique retailer published a note to customers ( ) this week in which it said that it limits quantities, a practice that it implemented last fall when the shortage wasn’t as severe.
“Our foremost goal is to serve our core customers and ensure that Micro Center has enough graphics cards for our customers in the [build your own] and gaming market segments,” a Micro Center spokesperson told Polygon. “We have put internal policies in effect to help safeguard our graphics card inventory so that we do not sell all of our inventory to crypto currency miners.”
Micro Center has now gone even further. The company has raised GPU prices on its website in line with retailers like Amazon and Newegg: For example, the cheapest price for MSI’s GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X (MSRP $459.99) is $945.99 on Amazon ( ) and $988.99 on Newegg ( ) ; it’s not much lower at Micro Center ( ) , which has it listed at $919.99. However, Micro Center noted in its letter that it is offering further discounts for “in-store bundled components” to reach “a final price well below the market,” and advised customers to “see a store manager to receive our best price.”
In other words, if you walk into a Micro Center to buy a graphics card as well as other PC components — as in, the kind of purchases you’d be making if you were building a gaming rig — a manager can provide a discount. Some customers said in a Reddit post ( ) today that they were even able to get the deals without a “bundle”; they simply told an employee that they wanted to buy a GPU for gaming purposes. To be clear, the discount will make the price more reasonable, but it probably won’t drop it all the way down to the MSRP. (Let’s take a second to note how strange this is: Everyone usually criticizes retailers for the practice of selling hot-ticket items in expensive bundles ( ) , but here, Micro Center is doing it as a good-faith effort to help gaming consumers!)
Reached for comment, a representative for New York-based electronics retailer B&H told Polygon, “In general, when we know an item is especially sought-after and is in short supply we will limit the quantity we will sell per transaction and monitor transactions to check if the same customers are placing multiple orders.” The spokesperson acknowledged that the system “is not perfect,” but said “it has proved to be effective in the past.” B&H lists the aforementioned MSI graphics card ( ) for $559.89, $100 above its MSRP — a veritable steal! — but it is out of stock.
As the shortage continues, it seems like the only truly effective solution will be for cryptocurrency mining to become less profitable — which might only happen if the bottom falls out of the cryptocurrency market. For now, gamers are left wondering just when the bitcoin bubble will burst.----




https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1050329/a-basic-glossary-of-terms-for-crypto-newbies

If you're new to the world of cryptocurrency, it's easy to get lost in a sea of incredibly complicated information, and some sources can be more reliable than others ( ). I've written a couple of introductory articles on bitcoin ( ) , Ethereum ( ) , and ether ( ). The glossary below explains some of the basic terms. I've also included a list of recommended sources at the end of this article.
*Blockchain* : a transparent, permanent ledger that registers every transaction and cryptographically links together a series of blocks in a way that prevents modifying previous blocks. Blockchain is also the underlying technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
*Consensus algorithm:* the process used to establish agreement on a single data value across a decentralized network of computers. In a blockchain, consensus algorithms are used to establish agreement on the contents of new blocks.
*DeFi* : the entire field of decentralized finance applications, covering many key pieces of financial infrastructure that are evolving to become more decentralized and open instead of relying on intermediaries. DeFi represents a paradigm shift from traditional financial systems to new models that rely on built-in, programmable, and interconnected protocols.
*Ether:* the native currency used by the Ethereum platform. In addition to serving as a digital currency and store of value, ether is also used to fuel computing power on the network, execute smart contracts, and compensate the miners who validate and verify transactions to add to the blockchain.
*Ethereum 2.0:* a major technology upgrade that has been approved by the Ethereum community and is currently being implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the major changes involves changing the security architecture from proof of work to proof of stake.
*Fiat currency:* a form of money or medium of exchange established by government regulation that has no intrinsic value, such as the U.S. dollar after President Nixon decoupled it from the gold standard in 1971.
*HODL:* short for "hold on for dear life," originally a typo on a late-night message board thread that has become shorthand for investors who advocate holding cryptocurrencies for the long term on despite any short-term volatility. Newer crypto investors often attempt to take advantage of short-term price moves, but it's generally agreed that short-term trading often underperforms the HODL strategy.
*Hot storage:* a method of cryptocurrency storage that uses public and private keys for security and uses either a browser extension wallet or an app wallet. Because these wallets are always connected to the Internet, they expose users to a nonzero risk of being hacked.
*Open-source:* source code (the basic instructions used to write a computer program) that is freely available for users to modify and redistribute. Open-source code allows anyone around the world to discover work that has already been done, improve on it without asking for permission, and send it back to the original developer (open collaboration). In this way, open-source code repositories that are interesting or otherwise important are constantly improved by people all around the world, similar to how Wikipedia pages are edited and improved over time.
*Private key:* a series of random characters (difficult to guess and similar to a password) that shows you have access to bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies in a specific wallet and can be used to verify ownership through a cryptographic signature. An owner of a private key can use a one-way function to generate a public key that is verifiably theirs but cannot be used to discover the private key. This is the basis for how one might verify ownership with a cryptographic signature.
*Proof of stake* : a system in which people can lock up, or stake, a certain amount of cryptocurrency to help validate transactions on the network. In exchange, they receive staking rewards. Because mining power is granted randomly based on the number of coins held in a node, it reduces the number of computations required to validate transactions.
*Proof of work* : a system that involves using a high-powered computer to test a series of algorithms, or hashing functions, to validate and confirm transactions. It relies on trial and error to generate a random series of numbers and letters until the program comes up with one that matches the original value. Proof of work is highly secure, but also massively inefficient because it requires so much computing power and electricity. Cryptocurrencies using proof of work generally use roughly 1,000 times more electricity than those secured by proof of stake.
*Satoshi Nakamoto:* the pseudonym for the person or people who envisioned and described Bitcoin in a white paper published in 2008. Satoshi was a member of the original “cypherpunk” community in the 1990s, which originally conceived of cryptographically secured currencies. Publication of the Bitcoin white paper release is widely considered to be a response to distrust of major financial institutions following the global financial crisis in 2008.
*Trustless system:* a system that relies on digital verification and algorithms instead of personal trust (knowing the person on the other side of the transaction) or relying on an intermediary such as bank, attorney, or payment processor.
* Bitcoin White Paper. The original white paper, "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," ( ) published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is available on Bitcoin.org ( ) , which also includes other educational resources.
* "The Guide to Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency for Investment Professionals." ( ) A paper by Matt Hougan and David Lawant published by the CFA Institute Research Foundation. While written for professional investors, the paper isn't overly technical and provides a good overview for other audiences, as well.

https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/07/what-you-need-to-know-about-zero-knowledge/

Jon Evans is the CTO of the engineering consultancy HappyFunCorp; the award-winning author of six novels, one graphic novel, and a book of travel writing; and TechCrunch's weekend columnist since 2010.
Anonymity? Privacy? How quaint. We live in a world bedecked with ever ( ) more cameras ( ) , ever more sensors, ever more drones, ever more data, ever fewer things that can be hidden. TLS ( ) and Tor ( ) can hide your online browsing, true — but, realistically, everything important you do, online or off, can easily be audited and tracked.
True, you can still send private messages. from Open WhisperSystems ( ) are the gold standard for secure messaging, and Dark Matter ( ) looks interesting. But if you want to go beyond messaging into transacting, your luck runs out.
Consider Bitcoin. It’s infamous as the currency of choice for dark markets — but it’s also, “in a sense, the least anonymous money that has ever existed, since every transaction is observable by anyone with a bitcoin account,” to quote ( ) economist David Friedman. Just ask alleged Silk Road kingpin Ross Ulbricht, who had 700,000 bitcoin on his laptop directly traceable ( ) to Silk Road’s accounts.
You can’t ask for payment in unmarked bitcoin; there’s no such thing. Claims ( ) that “Large European companies may eye Bitcoin as an option for securing their data and keeping it private from the United States” are currently comical. Sure, you can “tumble” your bitcoin payments, ie have them mixed and mingled with those of strangers, or perhaps use a service like Dark Wallet ( ) (which is essentially a distributed tumbler) — but then you have to implicitly trust that service to protect your anonymity…and not keep your money.
But you underestimate today’s mathematicians and cryptographers at your peril. I give you Zerocoin ( ) , a way to perform genuinely anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. It was intended as an extension to bitcoin, but is also fully workable as a separate and independent “zerocoin” cryptocurrency.
How is this possible? The concept is elegantly simple: zerocoins are drawn from a collective escrow pool which is defined, notated, and maintained on the host currency’s blockchain, and each coin’s transaction history is erased when it emerges from the pool. Transactions are verified by means of zero-knowledge proofs : a mathematical means to prove a truth without having to reveal any further verifying information. (For further details see this superb illustrated primer ( ) by Matthew Green, one of Zerocoin’s creators, or the original Zerocoin paper ( ).)
It’s more than just a fascinating concept; a startup called Moneta ( ) has gone and implemented ( ) the Zerocoin protocol (along with other blockchain improvements.) Their “genesis block” — the launch of their blockchain — is scheduled for the next few months.
Meanwhile, the Zerocoin people have expanded their initial proposal into an even more anonymized protocol, called Zerocash. Zerocash is not entirely trustless; it has to be initially set up ( ) by a trusted entity. Thereafter, though, its blockchain would allow transactions that did not contain any public information about their sender or receiver or amount — but all of these things can still be verified using zero-knowledge proofs. (Indeed, “ such proofs are less than 300 bytes long and can be verified in only a few milliseconds ( ).” They are memorably known as zk-SNARKs, for “zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge.”)
…But let’s not get too excited. Let’s throw a little cold water on these fever dreams. There are hundreds of would-be Bitcoin successors out there, and every one has failed to supplant the king of the heap. Bitcoin’s tech may seem increasingly obsolete (only five years in!) but its network effects seem to make it unassailable. Despite all the catcalls and lamentations of the last year, a single Bitcoin is still worth more than $200. That is beyond remarkable. Like Wikipedia, Bitcoin may not work in theory, but it’s nearly unstoppable in practice; and no other cryptocurrency will topple it from its perch any time soon.
That’s why pegged sidechains are important. I’ve written ( ) about them before ( ) ; basically, they’re a way to exchange bitcoins across an interwoven braid of many blockchains, and thus extend the protocol without having to somehow overthrow Bitcoin’s primacy. (Blockstream, the startup behind sidechains ( ) , recently raised $21 million, and counts among its founders several core Bitcoin developers.)
To my mind, Zerocoin and Zerocash are the low-hanging fruit of sidechains. Just transfer your bitcoin to a sidechain that implements one of those protocols, and voila, instant Bitcoin anonymity; you can send or receive money while maintaining mathematically perfect privacy. Will this have practical and regulatory repercussions? You bet. Will it always be a good thing? Realistically, probably not. But in a world creeping towards becoming the Panopticon of Things, one camera-enabled remote-controlled device at a time, anything that protects privacy is a good thing. Three cheers for zero knowledge.----




https://www.wired.com/2017/01/monero-drug-dealers-cryptocurrency-choice-fire/

For the cryptocurrency community, 2016 was a very good year. Bitcoin doubled in price. The far-out Bitcoin alternative Ethereum shot up by a factor of 10. But another, once-obscure cryptocurrency called Monero outpaced all of them, multiplying its value around 27-fold. That's a windfall not just for cryptocurrency speculators, but for financial privacy advocates everywhere---including a few suddenly wealthy dark web drug dealers.
Over the last year, the value of the hyper-anonymous cryptocurrency Monero grew 2,760 percent, making it almost certainly the best-performing cryptocurrency of 2016 ( ). Today each Monero is worth around $12, compared with just 50 cents at the beginning of last year, and the collective value of all Monero has grown to close to $165 million. The source of that explosive growth seems to be Monero's unique privacy properties that go well beyond the decentralization that makes Bitcoin so resistant to control by governments and banks. It's instead designed to be far more private: fully anonymous, and virtually untraceable.
Those features have made Monero a budding favorite within at least one community that has a pressing need for secrecy: the dark web black market. In August, the darknet market site Alphabay began offering its thousands of vendors the option to accept Monero as an alternative to Bitcoin. A quick browse through the market today shows dealers of everything from stolen credit cards to heroin to handguns accepting the stealthier cryptocoin. That increase in illicit users also illustrates Monero's privacy potential, says Riccardo Spagni, one of Monero's core developers.
It's tempting to think of cryptocurrencies in terms of Bitcoin---in part because many cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin derivations. Monero's fully its own entity, though. First outlined in an October 2013 whitepaper by the pseudonymous figure Nicolas van Saberhagen ( ) and called Cryptonote, another pseudonymous individual known only as "thankful_for_today" later coded those ideas into a currency called Bitmonero. When open-source coders on the Bitcointalk forum disagreed with thankful_for_today's directions for the currency, they forked it in 2014 to create Monero, whose name means simply "coin" in Esperanto.
Its structure solves several key privacy vulnerabilities that dog Bitcoin, which despite its reputation for secret transactions has long been stuck in a strange privacy paradox. Unlike commercial services like PayPal, Bitcoin allows anyone to spend money online without providing identifying details. But if someone's Bitcoin address is linked with their real identity, any transaction from that address is entirely visible on the public blockchain, the accounting ledger that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy. Hiding those transactions requires taking extra steps, like routing bitcoins through "tumblers" that mix up coins with those of strangers---and occasionally steal them---or using techniques like "coinjoin," built into some bitcoin wallet programs, that mix payments to make them harder to trace. "If I pay my rent in Bitcoin, it wouldn't be that hard for the landlord to figure out how much money I earned if I don't take extra precautions," says encryption and cryptocurrency consultant Peter Todd. "Then they can decide whose rent to increase. You’re giving away information you don't want to make public."
Monero not only bakes anonymity features into the cryptocurrency itself, but implements a few features that Bitcoin still can't offer. It uses a technique called "stealth addresses" to generate addresses for receiving Monero that are essentially encrypted; the recipient can retrieve the funds, but no one can link that stealth address to the owner. It employs a technique called "ring signatures," which means every Monero spent is grouped with as many as a hundred other transactions, so that the spender's address is mixed in with a group of strangers, and every subsequent movement of that money makes it exponentially more difficult to trace back to the source. And it uses something called "ring confidential transactions," which hides the amount of every transaction.
"Even with big data analysis, the ability to farm anything out of the metadata is cryptographically negligible," says Spagni. In future implementations, he notes that Monero will add the anonymity software I2P to mask not only users' transactions on the Monero blockchain, but also the internet traffic underlying those transactions.
All of that makes Monero a significant upgrade for a cryptocurrency user's financial privacy. Todd, for instance, says he keeps a small Monero account, but transfers bitcoins into it when he wants to spend his cryptocurrency more stealthily, using the exchange tool Shapeshift to transform the coins from Monero back to bitcoin before they reach the recipient's account. "I basically use Monero to pay people with bitcoin anonymously," Todd says.
That strict secrecy also helps explain Monero's darknet popularity. After Alphabay and a smaller dark web black market, known as Oasis, integrated the cryptocurrency last summer, its value immediately increased around six-fold. Alphabay told Bitcoin Magazine last month ( ) that the currency now accounts for about two percent of its sales. That's a small fraction, but still likely amounts to millions of dollars in annual revenue, given Alphabay's dominant position in the dark web drug market and estimates of that market's total size and growth ( ).
Spagni says he expects Monero will no doubt be used in other potentially unsavory ways, too, like ransomware, and as currency for the gambling and porn industries. But he argues it will also be used for more innocent forms of financial privacy, like keeping your net worth secret while making routine purchases, or buying contraband like outlawed books in oppressive regimes. He also argues the uses of Monero are out of his and his fellow developers' control. "I’m in no position to judge what people should or shouldn’t do, and no one else should be either from a code perspective," he says.
Monero isn't the first cryptocurrency designed to offer a financial privacy panacea: Dash, formerly known as Darkcoin ( ) , integrates the "coinjoin" technique that allows bitcoin users to mix their transactions with a few other spenders in what Todd calls a weaker form of anonymity than Monero offers. More recently, Zcash debuted with the strongest anonymity promises yet ( ) ---it uses cryptographic tricks designed to make tracing a transaction not only unlikely, but mathematically impossible. Zcash has yet to be integrated into dark web markets, though, and still requires wielding the command line to use.
Despite the currency's sudden spike in price, Spagni denies that he or any of the other core Monero coders are sitting on a massive pile of wealth. "We're just working on this to see where it goes," he says. But the promise and peril of Monero, of course, is that no one can check that claim. The stashes of the Monero developers, like those of its growing base of users, will stay secret by design.

https://news.cxihub.com/banks-should-be-allowed-to-trade-crypto-aaee5a23c5ad

During the Donald Trump administration took the position that banks could legally trade cryptocurrencies for their clients. The determination was made by staff at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), enabling banks to have digital currencies as assets for trading.
A top regulator quietly determined during the final days of the Trump presidency that banks are legally allowed to trade cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, in what could be a significant breakthrough for the digital assets, according to people familiar with the matter.
Banks’ formal move to green-light *crypto trading* ( ) would probably be met with resistance by advocates of tough financial rules. Moreover, the value of crypto assets can shift dramatically — Bitcoin is up about 400 percent from last year — making it potentially risky for both banks and depositors to trade in them.
Under Brooks’ watch, the agency did issue an interpretive letter allowing banks to process payments on a *blockchain* ( ) , a ledger for cryptocurrency transactions, which could also build the legal foundation for crypto trading activities by banks.
The U.S. Congress doesn’t do well-passing laws in new areas when they have not been adequately researched and crafted. The House of Representatives and Senate have been on the receiving end of telegraphed policies or viewpoints, not from a lack of trying. More than 18 bills have been put forth in 2021 by Congress, each one claiming to be more comprehensive than the next.
The crypto field is full of minutia, details, and nuances that only a dedicated entity will discern. When a new field emerges, it is common practice to create a dedicated team of people in the corporate world. There is a need to develop real experts who can spread their wisdom into other parts of the organization, rather than having disparate groups struggle on their own to master a topic when it has not been on their full-time radar.
In contrast, U.S. regulators are currently coming to crypto to dial back on the innovation and not set it on the right track. Ultimately, it’s the entrepreneurs who create all the value, and they should be the ones to empower to secure U.S. global leadership in this sector. Otherwise, the innovation drain and non-U.S.-based activities will continue to grow elsewhere. Not only does this hurt entrepreneurship, but it also prevents millions of consumers from benefiting from wealth creation opportunities around cryptocurrencies.
On 28 October 2021, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), issued a new update to its 2019 guidance to a risk-based approach for virtual assets and VASPs, paying particular attention to the DeFi industry. The aim of this is to maintain a level playing field for VASPs, based on the financial services they provide in line with existing standards applicable to financial institutions and other entities, as well as minimizing the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage between sectors and countries. The FATF guidelines mainly focus on six areas:
In the words of Pelle Brændgaard, CEO of crypto compliance startup Notabene, said that the new guidance is looking to determine VASPs in the DeFi ecosystem based on the revenue of its participants. He also said that “if a business is extracting transaction fees or direct revenue from a protocol that they control, they likely will be classified as a VASP. More fully decentralized protocols could be covered under certain cases as well, but not all cases.”
The update also invites for increased urgency from global regulators to implement the Travel Rule, an Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism regulation for financial institutions introduced by the FATF in 2019. If you want to know more about FATF Guidelines do read from the official website of FATF ( ).
After a government crackdown in China, many miners are betting on reliable access to energy and a more predictable regulatory environment in the US. According to data from the University of Cambridge, more than a third of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin is now drawn from machines in the US, up from less than a fifth last spring.
China had previously been the dominant country for companies to place computers working to unlock new bitcoin. But in May, the country signaled the start of a broader crackdown against bitcoin mining and trading aimed at ensuring government control of its economy.
After China’s clampdown, many miners also fled to nearby Kazakhstan. Earlier this month, the minister of energy in Kazakhstan, now the second-largest venue for bitcoin mining, said he plans to limit the amount of electricity that new bitcoin miners can use.
It was China’s promise of cheap coal-fired power that made it an early home for crypto miners. Before its near-total ban, the country accounted for almost half of the global computing power dedicated to bitcoin mining.
Russia’s low energy costs and cool climate enabled some companies to use surplus electricity to benefit from bitcoin’s surging prices earlier this year, but concerns are growing about illegal mining. So if you want to know more about Russia’s Largest Bitcoin Mining, do read our news at

http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/SecuritiesLaw_csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.htm

Staff ( *we* or *staff* ) of the Canadian Securities Administrators ( *CSA* ) are aware of an increase in the number of cryptocurrency offerings, such as initial coin offerings ( *ICO* ), initial token offerings ( *ITO* ) {2} ( #N_1_1_1_2_ ) and sales of securities of cryptocurrency investment funds.
Cryptocurrency offerings can provide new opportunities for businesses to raise capital and for investors to access a broader range of investments. However, they can also raise investor protection concerns, due to issues around volatility, transparency, valuation, custody and liquidity, as well as the use of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. {3} ( #N_1_1_1_3_ ) Also, investors may be harmed by unethical practices or illegal schemes, and may not understand the properties of the investment products that they are purchasing.
Many of these cryptocurrency offerings involve sales of securities. Securities laws in Canada will apply if the person or company selling the securities is conducting business from within Canada or if there are Canadian investors. Given the significant growth in this area and requests for guidance, we are publishing this Staff Notice to help financial technology ( *fintech* ) businesses understand what obligations may apply under securities laws. {4} ( #N_1_1_1_4_ )
This Staff Notice focuses on and cryptocurrency investment funds, and their intersection with cryptocurrency exchanges. However, this guidance should also be considered in the context of other cryptocurrency or distributed ledger technology-based offerings that may trigger securities law requirements.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are online exchanges that allow investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies can be made using either fiat currency (e.g., buying bitcoin using CAD or USD) or cryptocurrency (e.g., buying bitcoin using another cryptocurrency such as ether). We understand that in addition to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, cryptocurrency exchanges may also offer that have been sold pursuant to 
Cryptocurrency exchanges operate across the world, in many cases without government oversight or regulation. Prices for cryptocurrencies may differ significantly among exchanges, allowing for arbitrage opportunities. While arbitrage opportunities may not exist for extended periods in efficient markets, they can persist in inefficient ones. Investment funds that purchase cryptocurrencies from these exchanges for their portfolios should be aware that standards among exchanges can vary significantly.
Recently, several jurisdictions have taken steps to impose requirements on cryptocurrency exchanges, including with respect to identity verification, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and recordkeeping.
A cryptocurrency exchange that offers cryptocurrencies that are securities must determine whether it is a marketplace. Marketplaces are required to comply with the rules governing exchanges or alternative trading systems. If an exchange is doing business in a jurisdiction of Canada, it must apply to that jurisdiction's securities regulatory authority for recognition or an exemption from recognition. To date, no cryptocurrency exchange has been recognized in any jurisdiction of Canada or exempted from recognition.
Allowing that are securities issued as part of an to trade on these cryptocurrency exchanges may also place the business issuing the offside securities laws. For example, the resale of that are securities will be subject to restrictions on secondary trading. {5} ( #N_1_1_1_5_ )
ICOs/ITOs are generally used by start-up businesses to raise capital from investors through the internet. These investors are often retail investors. An is typically open for a set period, during which investors can visit a website to purchase in exchange for fiat currency or a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ether. The structures of will vary, and they may be used to raise capital for a variety of projects, including the development of a new cryptocurrency, distributed ledger technology, service or platform. Anyone with internet access can create or invest in an in many cases, they can do so anonymously.
In many ways, an can be very similar to an initial public offering ( *IPO* ). The can be similar to traditional shares of a company because their value may increase or decrease depending on how successfully the business executes its business plan using the capital raised.
Staff is aware of businesses marketing their as software products, taking the position that the are not subject to securities laws. However, in many cases, when the totality of the offering or arrangement is considered, the should properly be considered securities. In assessing whether or not securities laws apply, we will consider substance over form.
Every is unique and must be assessed on its own characteristics. For example, if an individual purchases that allow to play video games on a platform, it is possible that securities may not be involved. However, if an individual purchases whose value is tied to the future profits or success of a business, these will likely be considered securities.
We have received numerous inquiries from fintech businesses and their legal counsel relating to With the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts. In arriving at this conclusion, we have considered the relevant case law, {6} ( #N_1_1_1_6_ ) which requires an assessment of the economic realities of a transaction and a purposive interpretation with the objective of investor protection in mind.
To date, no business has used a prospectus to complete an in Canada. We anticipate that businesses looking to sell may do so under prospectus exemptions. Sales may be made to investors who qualify as "accredited investors" as defined under securities laws, in reliance on the accredited investor prospectus exemption. {7} ( #N_1_1_1_7_ ) For retail investors who do not qualify as accredited investors, sales will typically need to be made in reliance on the offering memorandum ( *OM* ) prospectus exemption. {8} ( #N_1_1_1_8_ )
We are aware that some fintech businesses publish whitepapers for their which may describe things such as the fundraising goal, the business, the project for which capital is being raised, how many management of the business will retain and how long the offering will remain open. Although whitepapers are a form of disclosure document for investors, it is important to note that they are often not structured in the same way as prospectuses or OMs. Investors must be provided with a document that complies with the requirements of securities laws. Under securities laws, prospectuses and OMs have specific disclosure requirements and trigger certain ongoing obligations and other protections for investors. For example, investors can sue for misrepresentations by management of the business in prospectuses and OMs.
Any disclosure provided to investors, whether an OM or otherwise, must not be false or misleading. The disclosure must focus on material facts and be relevant, clear, balanced, in plain language and not overly promotional.
Businesses completing may be trading in securities for a business purpose (referred to as the "business trigger"), therefore requiring dealer registration or an exemption from the dealer registration requirement. Whether or not an activity meets the business trigger is facts specific. {9} ( #N_1_1_1_9_ )
Individuals or businesses that meet the business trigger must meet fundamental obligations to investors, including know-your-client ( *KYC* ) and suitability. Collecting little to no information on investors, for example only names, email addresses IP addresses would not be sufficient to meet this obligation. Businesses conducting that meet the business trigger must verify investors' identities and collect sufficient information to ensure that purchases of are suitable, including on investment needs and objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance.
It is possible that a business that meets the business trigger could fulfil its KYC and suitability obligations through a robust, automated, online process that incorporates investor protections. These investor protections could include limits on investment amounts and concentration, as well as risk warnings.
Persons or companies facilitating of that are securities must have strong compliance systems in place, with policies and procedures that address cybersecurity risks. As cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, complex and costly, businesses in the cryptocurrency space should ensure that they have strong cybersecurity measures to safeguard the business and its investors.
We are aware of "investment funds" as defined under securities laws being set up to invest in bitcoin other cryptocurrencies. We understand from our discussions with the fintech community that one of the key purposes of this type of investment fund is to provide investors with the opportunity to obtain exposure to cryptocurrencies, or baskets of cryptocurrencies, that they may not otherwise have.
We want to encourage financial market innovation and facilitate capital raising by fintech businesses, while at the same time ensuring fair and efficient capital markets and investor protection. As cryptocurrencies become more popular and mainstream, balancing the demand for new investment opportunities and the need to protect investors from high-risk or fraudulent activities is extremely important.
In order to avoid costly regulatory surprises, we encourage businesses with proposed cryptocurrency offerings to contact their local securities regulatory authority to discuss possible approaches to complying with securities laws.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/06/10/bitcoin-investing-cryptocurrency-401-k-retirement-plans-launched/7640161002/

ForUsAll Inc., a 401(k) provider, announced earlier this month a deal with the institutional arm of Coinbase Global Inc., a leading cryptocurrency exchange, that will allow workers in plans it administers to invest up to 5% of their 401(k) contributions in bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and others, the Journal reported.
Bitcoin, which launched in 2009, is the original and the world’s most popular crypto. It was designed as an alternative to government money and is based on blockchain technology, which acts as a public ledger of transactions.
With just $1.7 billion in retirement-plan assets, ForUsAll represents a small piece of the $22 trillion retirement-account market, according to the Journal. But its embrace of crypto comes at a time of heightened mainstream interest in digital currencies.
Bitcoin bulls have called it a “store of value” – which has historically been reserved for safe-haven investments like gold – and argue that it’s a good investment to hedge against inflation.
That's because there’s not an unlimited supply of bitcoin. In fact, there are only 21 million bitcoins that can be mined, and about 18 million have been mined so far. Bitcoin mining is the process that creates cryptocurrency. It is resource-intensive in an effort to control the number of bitcoins in circulation.----




https://money.yahoo.com/bitcoin-crypto-investing-goes-mainstream-in-new-401-k-offering-214411478.html

Starting in July, ForUsAll Inc., a 401(k) provider, will let workers in retirement plans it administers to invest up to 5% of their contributions in the leading cryptocurrencies through Coinbase. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal ( ).
"When we created our institutional platform, our initial focus was making cryptocurrency accessible to institutional investors and high net worth individuals,” Brett Tejpaul, head of institutional sales, trading, and prime at Coinbase, said in a statement to Yahoo Money. “The next evolution is to broaden our reach and we are thrilled to be working with ForUsAll to expand access to cryptocurrency through 401(k)s.”
“There has been an absolute sea change in the investment world in the last few years with institutional professional investors making increasing use of alternatives, and more recently digital assets,” Ramirez told Yahoo Money. “Most individual investors don't have access to the same opportunities, nor the means to make good use of them. We're changing that.”
It may be too early to tell whether this is an industry-wide turning point or one-off phenomenon. ForUsAll manages 401(k) plans for just 400 employer clients, representing $1.7 billion in retirement-plan assets. That’s a small slice of the $22 trillion market.
The bigger players haven't jumped into crypto fully. Vanguard doesn’t allow customers to directly hold crypto through a Vanguard account, a spokesperson told Yahoo Money. Fidelity also doesn't allow direct investing in digital assets on its retail brokerage platform.
But some companies can offer a self-directed brokerage account in their Schwab 401(k) plan that allows investors to invest in over-the-counter cryptocurrency coin trusts such as Grayscale’s Ethereum and Bitcoin Trust products.
About 14% of certified financial planners currently use or recommend cryptocurrency, up from less than 1% in both 2019 and 2020, according to a survey of 529 professionals by the Financial Planning Association.
More than a quarter of advisers said they plan to increase their use or recommendation of cryptocurrencies over the next 12 months. And almost half of advisers said their clients had asked them about crypto in the last six months, up from 17% in 2020.
“Clients have definitely asked about crypto a lot lately,” said Christopher Lyman, a certified financial planner with Newtown, Pennsylvania-based Allied Financial Advisors, noting it’s mostly younger clients with fewer assets who are inquiring. “I always try to get them to disconnect from the headlines and astronomical numbers they see and try to remember the basics.”
“If a client is accessing crypto, they are adding it as a very small portion of their portfolio in a side account, like Robinhood, and considering it volatile play money,” he said. “It hasn't been a mainstream addition to their long-term portfolio.”
ForUsAll also isn’t trying to mask the asset’s volatility and attempts to curb risky behavior by limiting investments to 5% in contributions and alerting investors when their crypto investments exceed 5% of their account balance. Investors also must acknowledge reading disclosures explaining crypto’s volatility.
We “cannot change the fundamental nature of cryptocurrency,” Ramirez said. But the firm can educate investors “on the common pitfalls and mistakes that people often fall prey to when investing.”

Since 1996, the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) ( ) has required banks to send information about the originators and beneficiaries of cross-border financial transfers of over 1,000 along with each transaction. Known as the ‘travel rule’, the objective was to promote greater transparency and controls on money laundering or terrorist financing in cross-border transactions. Luckily for the traditional financial system, they already had protocols like SWIFT in place which made it relatively easy to implement the travel rule. But when the FATF extended the travel rule requirement to all global Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in June 2019, many feathers were ruffled. Though FATF recommendations are only required to be implemented by member jurisdictions, the change meant that in practical terms digital asset companies – exchanges and custodians – were now in the same position as traditional financial institutions when it comes to FATF obligations. In a bid to secure their own standing with regulators, major exchanges may demand non-custodial wallets to fall in line or be excluded from the ecosystem. To support them, the Travel Rule Working Group is creating a travel rule Standardised Format for BSV.

In May 1996, the US FinCEN introduced the “ Travel Rule ( ) ” requiring all financial institutions to send the originator and beneficiary information along with each financial transfer over $ 3,000 – hence the name “Travel Rule”. The objective was to enable AML CFT and sanctions screening across jurisdictions.
In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) extended the Travel Rule requirements with Recommendation 16 ( ) (R16), full name “Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers – Guidance for a  risk-based approach”,  to all global Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). In a nutshell, the guidance subjects VASPs to the same requirements as financial institutions.
In June 2020, the FATF published a 12 month review of the revised FATF standards on VAs and VASPs ( ) where it acknowledges gaps in global implementation and addresses stablecoins, the travel rule and unhosted wallets.
In March 2021, the FATF published a draft updated guidance ( ) in which it clarifies the definitions of VAs and VASPs giving concrete examples on what is in scope. This draft has been criticized by the industry as it is very extensive including in scope almost all types of VA activities; especially Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”) which was not previously included.
In July 2021, the FATF published the “Second 12 month review of the revised FATF standards on VAs and VASPs” ( ) in which it found that gaps in implementation created vulnerabilities, pressed for implementation of the travel rule, and provided market metrics on peer to peer transactions.
The FATF published the final version ( ) in October 2021 where amongst other things, it confirms that “exchange or transfer services may (…) occur through” DeFi, and thus bringing them into scope. The FATF clearly confirms that as long as “creators, owners and operators” maintain “control or sufficient influence”, and the service provides “financial services”, then it falls under the definition of a VASP.
While the Travel Rule sounds similar to Know Your Customer (“KYC”), it has a few key differences. The first is that during KYC, the data collected is only used by the organization that collects it. With the Travel Rule, certain KYC information needs to be shared between VASPs. Secondly, KYC is an internal process while the Travel Rule is a process between entities. Thirdly, the Travel Rule is an event-triggered obligation (at time of whereas KYC AML is an ongoing activity for the duration of the service to customer. In this process, it is expected that the originator VASP has done KYC on the originator, e.g. its customer, and the beneficiary VASP on the beneficiary, e.g. their customer.
The implementation deadlines are set by the related jurisdictions. For example, US FinCEN director Kenneth Blanco says Recommendation 16 is already in effect (via the existing Bank Secrecy Act). FinCEN announced on 23 Oct 2020 ( ) that the US Bank Secrecy Act applies to crypto assets, and the threshold will move (date yet to be confirmed) to $250 for international transactions. In Canada, compliance has been expected since June 2021. The EU has issued a proposal for a regulation on transfer of funds and certain crypto assets. The UK has also issued a proposal to amend the MLR 2017 and apply the travel rule to crypto assets businesses. Recommendation 16 is said to be in force in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Gibraltar, Singapore and South Korea as well.
Entities processing BitcoinSV transactions need mechanisms to comply with Travel Rule obligations. Methodologies that are standardised will assist with compliance across national borders, and between different entities within the same country.
The parties affected by the FATF’s Travel Rule are not only VASPs but also outsourced Identity Services (“IS”) which may (i) provide and attest to user data based on processes and (ii) perform checks of the entities involved on sanction lists.
To provide entities impacted by the Travel Rule with a standardised mechanism to meet their compliance obligations. This would enable businesses to demonstrate regulatory compliance in both local and international jurisdictions; enabling end-users to have the full ability to send BitcoinSV to other users, and to spend their BitcoinSV freely.
*Who is a VASP?* The FATF defines “ Virtual Asset Service Provider” as any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the recommendations and *as a business* , conducts one or more of the following activities or operations *for or on behalf of another natural or legal person* :
In October 2021, in its Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, the FATF further extended and clarified the scope of its recommendations. The FATF clearly confirms that as long as “creators, owners and operators” maintain *“control or sufficient influence”* and that the service provides *“financial services”* , then it falls under the definition of a VASP.
The FATF gives examples of what it means by “control or sufficient influence”: creation and launch of a virtual asset, developing DApp functions and user interfaces for accounts holding an administrative “key” or collecting fees, or setting parameters. *The notion of “providing financial services” is key.*
The FATF is pushing countries to *implement the travel rule as soon as possible* while also acknowledging that this might still be challenging; and allowing countries to “take a staged approach to enforcement of travel rule requirements”.
*Are un-hosted transactions included?* FATF defines as follows ” ‘Peer-to-peer’ (P2P) transactions are VA transfers conducted without the use or involvement of a VASP or other obliged entity, such as VA transfers between two unhosted wallets. P2P transactions are not explicitly subject to obligations under the FATF Recommendations. This is because the FATF Recommendations generally place obligations on intermediaries between individuals and the financial system, rather than on individuals themselves with some exceptions, such as requirements related to targeted financial sanctions.”.
a) controls that facilitate visibility of P2P activity and VA activity crossing between obliged entities and non-obliged entities (these controls could include VA equivalents to currency transaction reports or reporting of cross-border instrument transfers);
b) ongoing enhanced supervision of those VASPs and entities operating in the VA space which have features enabling unhosted wallet transactions (e.g., on-site and off-site supervision to confirm whether a VASP has complied with the regulations in place concerning these transactions);
Recommendation 16 then establishes the domestic and international requirements for countries relating to wire transfers and related messages. In summary, countries should ensure that FIs include required and accurate originator information, and required beneficiary information on wire transfers and related messages. FIs should also monitor wire transfers to detect those which lack the required originator beneficiary information and screen the transactions to comply with relevant UNSCR resolutions). Guidance is provided highlighting the importance of VASPs applying risk-based approach to dealing with customers that engage in, or facilitate, P2P transactions, supported by risk assessment, indicators or typologies publications where appropriate.
*Are Dapps and multi-sig transactions included?* A DeFi application itself (i.e. the software program) is not a VASP under the FATF standards, since the standards do not apply to underlying software or technology. However, creators, owners and operators, or some other persons who maintain control or sufficient influence in the DeFI arrangements, even if those arrangements seem decentralized, may fall under the FATF definition of a VASP. For example, there may be control or sufficient influence over assets or over aspects of the service’s protocol and the existence of an ongoing business relationship between themselves and users; even if this is exercised through a smart contract or in some cases voting protocols. Service providers who cannot complete transactions without a key held by another party are not disqualified from falling under the definition of a VASP; irrespective of how many parties are involved in signature construction, which party has control or how the signature is constructed.
*Wha* *t must a VASP do?* All entities classified as VASP’s shall perform Customer Due Diligence (Know-Your Customer or KYC) before on-boarding a customer. They shall also perform various AML and CFT procedures on a regular basis to detect and report suspicious activity. Each jurisdiction will have licensing and operational requirements of a VASP, which is outside the scope of the Travel Rule standard itself. The requirements of Recommendation 16 apply to VASPs whenever their transactions, whether in fiat currency or VA, involve: (a) a traditional wire transfer, or (b) a VA transfer between a VASP and another obliged entity (e.g, between two VASPs or between a VASP and another obliged entity, such as a bank or other FI), or (c) a VA transfer between a VASP and an unhosted wallet (i.e. a non-VASP or non-obliged entity). For transactions involving VA transfers, countries should treat all VA transfers as cross-border wire transfers rather than domestic wire transfers. For transfers with unhosted wallets, the requirements of R.16 apply in a specific way. Information is collected from the customer but not sent to the unhosted wallet.
*What about BSV-based stablecoins and tokens?* FATF has clarified that stablecoins and tokens are defined as VA’s, and are within scope of the Travel Rule. Central-bank issued stablecoins are not considered VA’s, and are instead regulated under its fiat currency regulations. The scope of this Travel Rule standard is intended to include BSV-based stablecoins and tokens, to the degree this is technically possible.
*What information must be collected?* Recommendation 16 establishes the requirements for countries relating to wire transfers and related messages and applies to both domestic and cross-border wire transfers. In summary, countries should ensure that VASP’s include required and accurate (information that has been verified) originator information, and required beneficiary information, on wire transfers and related messages. VASP’s should also monitor wire transfers to detect those which lack the required originator beneficiary information and screen the transactions to comply with relevant UN resolutions. The required information of originators and beneficiaries includes:
Travel Rule d.d. 1997* i) originator’s name (i.e., the sending customer); The name of the transmitter, ii) originator’s account number where such an account is used to process the transaction The account number of the transmitter, if used, iii) originator’s physical (geographical) address, *or* national identity number,
*or* customer identification number (i.e., not a transaction number) that uniquely identifies the originator to the ordering institution, *or* date and place of birth; The address of the transmitter, iv) beneficiary’s name; The name of the recipient, The address of the recipient, v) beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the transaction The account number of the recipient,
Figure 1 on page 54 (item 159) of the March 2021 Guidance Note is a useful reference for the requirements of both the ‘ordering’ and ‘beneficiary’ VASPS’s. In the VA context, ‘account number’ could mean the “wallet address” of the VA and the “public key” of the customer who is sending the VA transfer. Even though the US requires geographical addresses, most emerging markets have abandoned address as a required field, as it is exclusionary and impossible to verify reliably. Date-of-Birth is more widely-accepted in those countries. VASPs who don’t hold address data should consider blocking transfers from US related entities (including VASPs).
184. It is vital that countries ensure that providers of VA transfers—whether VASPs or other obliged entities—transmit the required originator and beneficiary information immediately and securely.
186. “Securely”, also in the context of INR. 15, paragraph 7(b), is meant to convey that providers should transmit and store the required information in a secure manner. This is to protect the integrity and availability of the required information to facilitate record-keeping (among other requirements), facilitate the use of such information by receiving VASPs or other obliged entities and protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.
As freezing options are limited, especially for non-custodial VASPs using a mnemonic with known  derivation paths, the receiving and sending entities should be able to conclude their due diligence before signing and sending their respective part of a binding transaction. This may mean, strictly speaking, that the Travel Rule information is sent before the transfer (e.g. during an invoice phase) and not simultaneously or concurrently. Traditional correspondent banking payments use a MT202 COV ( ) message ( ) to send the Travel Rule information.
*Who should the information flow to?* A VASP needs to undertake counterparty VASP due diligence before they transmit the required information to their counterparty. VASPs do not need to undertake the counterparty VASP due diligence process for every VA transfer, unless there is a suspicious transaction history indicating they should. Note that transactions may not necessarily start end at a VASP. Note also that a VASP may also have customers in multiple jurisdictions and itself may have operating legal entities in multiple jurisdictions.
203. The FATF recognizes that unlike traditional fiat wire transfers, not every VA transfer may involve (or be bookended by) two obliged entities, whether a VASP or other obliged entity such as a FI. In instances in which a VA transfer involves only one obliged entity on either end of the transfer (e.g., when an ordering VASP or other obliged entity sends VAs for or on behalf the originator to a beneficiary that is not a customer of a beneficiary institution but rather an individual VA user who receives the VA transfer to an unhosted wallet), countries should still ensure that the obliged entity adheres to the requirements of Recommendation 16 with respect to their customer (the originator or the beneficiary, as the case may be).
204. The FATF does not expect that VASPs and FIs, when originating a VA transfer, to submit the required information to individuals who are not obliged entities. VASPs sending or receiving a VA transfer an entity that is *not* a VASP or other obliged entity (e.g., from an individual VA user to an un-hosted wallet), *should obtain the required originator and beneficiary information from their customer*. Countries should require their VASPs or other obliged entities to implement mechanisms to ensure effective scrutiny of such transfers, in particular to meet their STR and sanctions implementation obligations (see the discussion of Recommendation 20 below) and, as discussed above, may choose to impose additional limitations or controls on such transfers with unhosted wallets.
191. Countries may choose to adopt a de minimis threshold for VA transfers of 1 000 in line with the FATF Standards, having regard to the risks associated with various VAs and covered VA activities. If countries choose to implement such a threshold, there are comparatively fewer requirements for VA transfers below the threshold compared to VA transfers above the threshold. *For VA transfers under the threshold, countries should require that VASPs collect: a. the name of the originator and the beneficiary; and b. the VA wallet address for each or a unique transaction reference number.*
The above low-value threshold implies that for all VA transactions processed by a VASP, that certain information about both sender and receiver are required and transferred. VASPs should confirm such processing requirements below the threshold in their jurisdiction.
FATF also provides (under the KYC requirements of Recommendation 10) a recommended treatment for ‘occasional transactions’ below however, these need to be demonstrably once-off and that no ongoing ‘business relationship’ exists with the customer.
As each jurisdiction enacts local legislation to give effect to the FATF recommendations, each entity in the VA blockchain domain should conduct their own analysis to determine their compliance obligations. The analysis contained in this document is intended as an overview, and not as legal opinion. The FATF has emphasised that a “functional approach” should be adopted by regulators to assess the true objectives and not the legal form of the transaction. FATF notes: “ In addition, countries should aim to keep regulation and supervision for VASPs consistent with that which it uses for FIs that provide functionally similar services with similar risks. As with FIs and DNFBPs, countries should therefore subject VASPs to requirements that are functionally equivalent to other entities when they offer similar products and services with similar risks and based on the activities in which the entities engage.”
The following statement from the FATF is perhaps the clearest statement of intent: ” Despite the many and frequently changing marketing terms and innovative business models developed in this sector, *the FATF envisions very few VA arrangements will form and operate without a VASP involved at some stage if countries apply the definition correctly.* ”
The approach taken was to attempt to use existing standards and protocols, rather than create an entirely new architecture to solve this problem. Essentially there are two parts to the proposed standard:
In May 2020, a joint working group of 3 global standard setting bodies in the VA industry proposed the “interVASP Messaging Standard – IVMS101 ( ) ”. This standard details the data formats and minimal requirements for the data which VASPs need to share (and review) prior to completing a transaction. It does not specify how this data should be communicated between VASPs. Furthermore, the IVMS101 data model is yet to be ratified by the 3 global standard setting bodies. An update taking into consideration some small corrections and enhancements is anticipated in due course. The IVMS standard appears to be widely-adopted as a data-formatting standard. A software tool that can verify the compliance of messages to the IVMS standard has recently been released by the OpenVASP Association and can be useful for VASP’s: 
To exchange Travel Data between VASPs, the VASP of the payment initiator (initiator can be originator or beneficiary of funds) faces the problem of host discovery for counterparty. Bitcoin SV has solved this problem with Paymail since the VASP identity is part of the user identity. Although chain agnostic Paymail-equivalents have emerged (e.g. PayID ( ) and FIO-protocol ( ) ), most exchanges still use public keys and seem to resort to either:
* “Bulletin Board” solutions: Proposed by USTRWG. The initiating VASP posts the public key of the counterparty on a bulletin board of the relevant chain and waits until a VASP indicates that particular key is hosted by them so a secure communication channel can be setup to exchange Travel Rule information
* “Brute force testing” solutions: Proposed by ING’s Travel Rule Protocol. Each VASP maintains a list of trusted correspondent VASPs and queries through a defined API whether they manage the beneficiary public key. Brute force can be avoided if the originator can identify the correspondent VASP beforehand.
For the data formatting standards, we recommend the IVMS101 standard and the Google Protocol Buffers ( ) derived by CipherTrace – used by the ING TRP working group. Note that a number of issues re IVMS101 listed on the interVASP ( ) website still need to be resolved. In addition, the authors of this spec have raised the following inconsistencies with the relevant people involved in IVMS101 and the TRP:
* IVMS101 allows m-to-n transfers (multiple originators to multiple beneficiaries), but only 1 originatorVASP to 1 beneficaryVASP. We have recommended to only allow 1-to-1 txs. In case VASPs decide to combine multiple transfers in 1 tx, they should document the underlying transfers separately.
Logically, regulators request a link to an account number in order to have an efficient link to the ledger from where they can further analyse the money flow. To reproduce such a link for a UTXO-based-ledger, for each transaction the txid and inputs and outputs related to each originator and beneficiary should be stored (instead of an account number).
However, this raises the question of data storage. A VASP can maintain such a link in its system, but a more visible link may be preferable, and more useful to authorities wanting to scrutinise the data. Therefore, the Travel Rule Protocol group has come up with a method ( ) to store all relevant tx data as an “extension” to the IVMS101 handshake. See also the BIP270 JSONs further on.
The principle adopted is that the minimum set of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be shared between the entities. VASPs need to indicate to each other which IVMS fields are required, and only share data for those fields. It is understood this is feasible via the technical implementation.
Often Identity Services are expected to perform a check of this person against the relevant sanctions lists. The input data required to perform a Sanctions Check is typically the full name, nationality, DOB (or at least year of birth) and country of residence. The IS can store the outcome and add any matches to a watch list. Whenever the outcome changes (an IS typically keeps the person on  a watch list), the IS is expected to immediately submit the updated JSON to the VASP; thereby spurring the VASP to take action. Sanction check information is not part of IVMS101.
To collect the above IVMS101 data for natural persons, an IS or VASP will generally request a copy of a passport and a proof of address. The passport contains very useful fields such as Nationality and Date of Birth, which are not required or mandatory in the IVMS standard. However, these fields are often required in an on-boarding process; e.g. a gambling or financially oriented app, and they are also useful for sanction list checks. For those reasons we define a separate JSON data structure which captures the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) defined in ICAO9303 ( ) for Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). If the customer agrees to it, an IS can then give the ICAO9303-MRZ-JSON to a VASP in addition to the IVMS101-natPer-JSON for a marginal additional cost. Note that we expect Identity Services to allow users to choose which fields to populate – for example they may not want “sex” to be populated.
BIP270 is a draft working standard that evolved from the BIP70 payment protocol. The Invoice-based Payments Working Group is developing a new standard (internal designation TS 2021.014) which is intended to replace BIP270. Where the word “BIP270” appears in this document, reference is indicated to the latest Invoice-based Payments standard. The process flow depicted below remains relevant; however, implementors of this component of the Travel Rule standard should be aware of this update, and ensure they are using the latest issued protocols.
In a professional e-procurement process the KYB data of the vendor (beneficiary Travel Data) is provided here so the customer can include this information in its vendor due diligence before committing. For example, a customer may not be able to do business with Iranian vendors or certain PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons) owning the business. This data can alternatively be delivered by the vendor as part of, for example, a quote in pdf format outside of the BIP270 process. As the URI used in BIP270 at this step does not easily allow for communication of beneficiary Travel Data from vendor to customer, this standard does not include a proposal to share beneficiary Travel Data at this step in the BIP270 process.
As (i) a beneficiaryVASP may, for example, not want to receive funds from (legal) persons in certain black-listed countries, and as (ii) some beneficiaryVASPs are not able to return such funds as they are not custodial, a beneficiaryVASP needs to be able to complete DD before committing to receive funds (i.e. before sending the outputs in the “Serves tx template” step). This means that the originatorVASP needs to send the Travel Data of the originator to the vendor at the preceding “Engages URI” step.
Before sending the Travel Rule information, the customer reviews (performs due diligence on) the merchant’s quote and Travel Rule information. By “engaging the URI” the customer accepts the quotation and the VASP sends (together with a Purchase Order number) the originator’s and originator VASP’s Travel Rule information to the Merchant. It would be advisable for a VASP to warn a user that they are about to send their name and address details to the counterparty when “engaging the URI”. It is also recommended for an originatorVASP to indicate whether the beneficiaryVASP is known trusted.
The parts in bold are additions to the existing HandCash implementation. The Purchase Order number submitted by the customer in the previous step is returned. At this step a vendor should also produce a (pdf-)invoice which can include the name and address of the customer. A JSON invoice could include very rich item level data (e.g. including product level EAN codes).
Enterprise customers will at this stage complete 3-way matching of invoice, purchase order and delivery receipt. Private buyers are likely to check the amount requested and assess the likelihood they will receive the goods they asked for. Then the customer adds the required inputs, signs the tx and returns it to the vendor.
In case a VASP choses to outsource services to an Identity Service, it can receive the required JSONs as follows. Paymail hosts (a.k.a. Wallets or VASPs) add the following capabilities to.well-known ( ) :
* IS to perform analysis based on data supplied by the user (e.g. copy of passport, proof of address, live selfie, etc.). Note that generally the on-boarding of a customer is the legal responsibility and accountability of the VASP which can not be delegated, although they may outsource certain activities (and again that may be constrained by legislation).
* FAFT has clarified that *Central Bank-issued digital currencies are not VAs*. The FATF Standards however apply to central bank digital currencies similar to any other form of fiat currency issued by a central bank.
* *As each jurisdiction has different specific requirements for compliance, it may be out of scope as to whether the specific information provided shared is sufficient for full compliance.* For example FAFT does not always require the full address of the beneficiary (and SWIFT messages only carry the full address of the originator, not the beneficiary), but the US Bank Secrecy Act requires addresses of both parties. Each VASP must determine which regulations it must comply with (i.e. if there is a US nexus, the US Bank Secrecy Act may apply).
* *Paymail based transactions initiated by originator* : As Travel Rule data needs to be shared and reviewed before committing to a transfer (non-custodial VASPs using mnemonics and known derivation paths usually can’t freeze funds), the current flow of P2P Transactions ( ) (originator initiated process) needs to be extended and preceded by additional steps handshakes (this does not necessarily affect the UX). However the current BIP270 (beneficiary initiated process) does already contain the required handshakes leading up to the transfer of funds.
* *Non-protocol tokens:* The Travel Rule also applies when tokens (e.g. stable coins or securities) with a value in excess of $ 1,000 are transferred (note that in such cases the token issuer is potentially an “Intermediary VASP”).
* *Standards for on-chain storage of Travel Data:* Storing privacy sensitive data (encrypted) on-chain may have onerous legal implications and may not be preferred by users. Therefore, this standard does not mandate where the records are stored. The data structures should be stored by the VASP in a compliant way.

https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2020/11/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica-and-eu-digital-finance-strategy

The European Commission published its new Digital Finance Strategy on 24 September 2020. One of its centrepieces is the draft Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), designed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU. In our working paper ‘ The Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) and the EU Digital Finance Strategy ( ) ’ we analyse MiCA in the context of existing EU financial regulation.
The new Digital Finance Strategy (DFS) is part of a broader approach to the future development of digital finance and innovation in the EU, embodied in a new Digital Finance Package. The new Package comprises this new DFS and a renewed Retail Payments Strategy in an effort to ‘boost Europe’s competitiveness and innovation in the financial sector, paving the way for Europe to become a global standard-setter.’ By pursuing enhanced consumer choice while at the same time ensuring consumer protection and financial stability, the Commission ‘aims to boost responsible innovation in the EU’s financial sector, especially for highly innovative digital startups, while mitigating any potential risks related to investor protection, money laundering and cybercrime’.
The new DFS provides a very broad and comprehensive framework for future reforms to further the development of digital finance in the EU. While some of its building blocks were sketched out in the EU Commission’s FinTech Action Plan of 2018, the DFS represents a major step forward. In particular, the DFS promises new proposals on prudential regulatory treatment of crypto-assets, on SME financing, and on the role of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the Internet of Things (IoT). It also provides support for a possible central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the European Central Bank (ECB), which was the subject of a separate ECB report published later the same week.
The most developed aspects of the DFS at this stage are the legislative proposals for an EU regulatory framework on crypto-assets to support passporting for innovative startups across the EU, including in relation to crypto-assets. These include the proposal for a new regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and a new proposal for a Regulation on a Pilot Regime for Market Infrastructures based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT Infrastructure Regulation). While MiCA deals with crypto-assets (understood as ‘a digital representation of values or rights that can be stored and traded electronically’), the DLT Infrastructure Regulation is described as introducing a ‘sandbox’ approach for DLT-based market infrastructures, which allows temporary derogations from existing rules to assist regulators in gaining experience.
MiCA is the EU’s response to the policy debate prompted by the Libra proposal in June 2019. With it the EU Commission has proposed bespoke regulation for utility tokens and stablecoins including payments tokens, asset-backed tokens and ‘significant’ stablecoins (including ‘global stablecoins’). As to investment and securities tokens, the EU DFS relies on the existing body of EU financial and securities law, with the Prospectus Regulation, the MiFID framework and UCITSD and AIFMD at its core, with the intention to incorporate necessary changes as part of existing ongoing amendment and review processes. MiCA provides for a bespoke prospectus regime for crypto-assets, while the issuing of e-money tokens (ie payment tokens), asset-referenced tokens (also known as stablecoins) and crypto-asset services would become regulated activities subject to licensing. Supervision of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) will rest with national authorities, whereas supervision of ‘significant’ asset-referenced and e-money tokens will rest mainly with the European Banking Authority. Thus, with MiCA, the question of how the market for crypto-assets will be regulated under EU law is now answered.
We find that the EU DFS marks a very important step for the EU in developing both innovation and the Single Market. MiCA is an ambitious legislative project that responds to an urgent policy need. Yet the need was entirely different for ‘simple’ crypto-assets on the one hand, and payment tokens on the other hand.
Simple crypto-assets under MiCA will, in principle, be primarily utility tokens (perhaps with some monetary component), as other tokens will be subject to the existing body of EU law. For these other types of tokens, investor protection may warrant legislative intervention, with a strict application of existing EU financial law—and the definition of ‘financial instrument’, in particular—providing the alternative. While MiCA clearly fills any (perceived) gap, it fails to meet the second policy goal in the European Single Market: a harmonized application of EU financial law concepts across all EU and EEA Member States. The MiCA route is apparently easy, but its practical repercussions may well enrich lawyers and infuriate market participants for years. Thus, we propose that guideline-issuing competence should be conferred upon ESMA (as the authority in charge of financial instruments) to ensure a harmonized application of EU financial law.
The regulation of payment tokens, on the other hand, is well justified from a financial stability perspective given that a well-functioning payment infrastructure lies at the heart of all financial systems. In this regard, MiCA has indeed filled a gap, often by leaning on existing rules of the E-Money Directive. While this approach may be justified for small token offerings, it does not provide a suitable legal environment for truly large global stablecoins of global importance. We recommend the insertion of cooperation mechanisms similar to systemically important market infrastructures of international importance with regard to global stablecoins.
More broadly, MiCA does not stand on its own but is part of an ambitious and comprehensive approach of the sort we view as essential. However, further substantial revision of its detailed provisions, in the ways outlined in our paper ( ) , will be necessary if MiCA is to achieve its various goals.

Unlike dollar bills and coins, cryptocurrencies are not issued or backed by the U.S. government or any other government or central bank. The lack of a physical token to count and hold may confuse some. Rather, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currency used in electronic payment transactions—no coins, paper money or banks are involved; there are zero to minimal transaction fees; transactions are fast and not bound by geography; and, similar to using cash, transactions are anonymous.
Each digital wallet contains encrypted information, called public and private keys, that is used to send and receive the digital currency. All digital currency transactions are recorded in a virtual public ledger called the “blockchain,” which is maintained by digital currency “miners.” These miners can be anyone, anywhere in the world, who is willing to invest in the specialized computer hardware needed to rapidly process complex computations. Miners are awarded digital currency, like Bitcoin, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, in exchange for verifying each transaction and adding it to the blockchain.
Thirty-three states and Puerto Rico have pending legislation in the 2021 legislative session. Seventeen states enacted legislation or adopted resolutions. For example, Arizona created a blockchain and cryptocurrency study committee. Arkansas clarified control of virtual currency under the Uniform Commercial Code and amended the Uniform Money Services Act to include virtual currency. Hawaii adopted a resolution requesting the department of commerce and consumer affairs to reconsider its 2016 ruling on asset reserve requirements for virtual currency companies and cryptocurrency companies to conduct business in Hawaii and to align the state’s asset reserve requirements for these companies with the asset reserve requirements in other states.
Indiana repealed the unclaimed property act and replaced it with the revised unclaimed property act that includes virtual currency. Kentucky created the new section of KRS 139 which defines various terms relating to commercial mining of cryptocurrency using blockchain technology. Louisiana adopted a resolution commending Bitcoin for its success in becoming the first decentralized trillion dollar asset and encourages the state and local governments to consider ways that could help them benefit from the increased use of this new technology.

The state then attempts to return the property to its rightful owner. Generally, if the state is unable to return the property to its owner, the state may retain the property. Under current law, a holder of unclaimed property submits the property to the secretary of revenue who is the administrator of the act. The bill designates the Department of Revenue as the administrator and makes various changes to the act in order to make the act easier to administer. For example, the bill updates the act to address the disposition of unclaimed gift cards, life insurance benefits, securities, and virtual currencies. The bill also organizes the act chapter into subchapters in order to facilitate the act’s administration.

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/2/17/us-justice-department-taps-new-cryptocurrency-czar

The Justice Department named a veteran cybersecurity prosecutor to lead a new team dedicated to investigating and prosecuting illicit cryptocurrency schemes carried out by cyber criminals and nation states including North Korea and Iran.
Eun Young Choi will be the first director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, which will serve as the focal point for efforts to identify and dismantle the misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced Thursday.
“If we’re going to see — as I think we will — cryptocurrency gaining more traction and gaining wider adoption, we’ve got to make sure that the ecosystem that they operate in can be trusted and, frankly, can be policed,” Monaco said in an interview. “We’re going to make it our business to go after them and get those proceeds back and make it clear to them that they can’t hide.”
Prosecutors and regulators are rushing to determine how to police that space — as well as the market for other digital assets such as nonfungible tokens — which has become a new frontier for criminals and rogue nations to steal and launder billions of dollars through anonymous avenues like blockchain transactions, encryption and digital wallets.
Illicit transactions jumped almost 80% to $14 billion, an all-time high, in 2021, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Still, crime made up a much smaller share of total crypto transaction volume, which increased drastically last year, the firm said.
One of the main focuses for the new team will be rooting out illegal activity on virtual currency exchanges as well as cryptocurrency tumbler, or mixing, services, which are used to obscure tainted funds, Choi said in an interview.
Known among her colleagues as “EYC,” Choi most recently served as senior counsel to Monaco on cybersecurity matters. The crypto team is housed within the department’s criminal division and has more than a dozen experienced prosecutors with plans to hire more personnel.
When the creation of the crypto team was announced in October, Monaco said a key focus would be bringing cases against cryptocurrency exchanges and other entities that are found to be violating the law and assisting in the movement of illicit financing. The team would add support to current probes while pursuing new ones.
Although Choi didn’t single out any exchanges by name, Bloomberg News previously reported that the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are investigating whether Binance Holdings Ltd., the world’s biggest crypto trading platform, is a conduit for money laundering and tax evasion.
“The information they hold is crucial to rooting out the abuse of cryptocurrencies because they’re the ones who can see in their own systems suspicious activities that may be happening,” she said.
In a sign of the scale of the challenge U.S. law enforcement faces, the Justice Department this month seized Bitcoin valued at about $3.6 billion that was stolen during a 2016 hack, the largest financial seizure ever. In addition, the U.S. Marshals Service — which is the primary custodian of seized assets for the department — was in possession of $919 million in 22 different cryptocurrencies at the end of 2021.
In one of her first major cases, she led the successful prosecution of the 2014 hack against JPMorgan Chase & Co., which saw hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by hackers and conspirators in more than a dozen countries. She also argued the appeal in the case against Ross Ulbricht, the founder and chief administrator of the now-shuttered Silk Road underground virtual drug bazaar.
“What her appointment shows is that cryptocurrency is really at the intersection of complex financial investigations, cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, narcotics trafficking and cross-border enforcement,” said Edward Imperatore, who was a colleague of Choi in the cybercrime unit of the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan. “She has experience in each one of these areas.”
As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, the potential for wrongdoing has increased exponentially. Crypto fraud now cuts across a swath of activity including financial crimes, bribery, narcotics cases, ransomware attacks, hacking attacks, money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evasion, Choi said.
Choi’s team will lead the department’s efforts to coordinate with U.S. and international law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies and private industry. It also will enhance the criminal division’s existing efforts to provide support and training to federal, state, local and international law enforcement agencies.
Companies are concerned that Justice and regulatory agencies will take a heavy handed approach toward enforcement actions, according to a former federal prosecutor who asked to remain anonymous speaking about relations between private companies and the department.
U.S. agencies struggled for years to get companies to disclose hacking attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. Those private-sector victims feared such reporting would put them in the crosshairs of prosecutors or that there might be some regulatory blowback. But U.S. officials have expressed hope that they’ve turned a corner in recent years, especially with successful efforts to help companies recover stolen funds.
In addition to this month’s Bitcoin seizure in the Bitfinex hacking case, last year the U.S. recovered almost all the Bitcoin ransom paid to the perpetrators of a cyber attack on Colonial Pipeline Co. that sparked a fuel shortage along the U.S. east coast.----




https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/south-africas-4-billion-in-crypto-scams-has-regulators-scrambling-to-bring-in-new-regulations-within-the-next-three-to-six-months/articleshow/84015957.cms

South Africa is now locked in a race against time to bring in new regulations to curb the misuse of cryptocurrencies ( ) in the country. So far this year, the country has faced two of the biggest crypto scams in the world, which has wiped off nearly $4 billion of investor wealth.
The authorities are looking to have better controls in place before another scam hits investors. Kuben Naidoo, chief executive officer of South Africa's banking regulator known as the Prudential Authority and deputy governor of the South African central bank, told Bloomberg ( ) that these new laws will likely be finalised within the next three to six months.
The first move is likely going to be establishing proper know-your-customer (KYC) norms for crypto exchanges and the creation of systems to prevent money laundering, not unlike what South Korea ( ) is trying to put in place right now.
“Crypto assets will be brought into the South African regulatory purview in a phased and structured manner,” the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group said in a statement ( ) earlier this month. The organisation released a position paper consisting of 25 recommendations and an outline of a possible regulatory framework, which includes the need for better financial literacy for consumers as the retail interest in digital currency ( ) grows.
The first scam unfolded in January when a company called Mirror Trading International — which operated as a “crypto trading club” and promised investors 10% returns — reportedly ( ) absconded with $170 million.
However, this scam pales in comparison to the one flagged in April, when the founders of investment platform Africrypt disappeared with $3.8 billion in Bitcoin, after sending investors an email claiming that the platform had been hacked. This is the biggest known crypto heist in the history of the world so far.
Earlier this month, Africrypt’s lawyers told ( ) Bloomberg that the founders had terminated their contract as well. “Our mandate to assist the Cajee Brothers has been terminated,” the attorney, John Oosthuizen, said when asked about the Raees and Ameer Cajee’s whereabouts.
While money was lost, the FSCA found itself in a conundrum with respect to the investigation. “At this stage we have only found evidence of crypto asset ( ) transactions. Currently crypto assets are not regulated in terms of any financial sector law in South Africa and consequently the FSCA is not in a position to take any regulatory action,” the FSCA said in a statement ( ) on June 24.
The authority also warned the public of the ‘high-risk nature of investing in crypto assets’ and said it had concerns about the suitability of crypto assets as an asset class because of the ‘underlying business models’ of crypto firms and the ‘risk of large fluctuations in the market price’.

https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/south-korea-tightens-regulations-on-cryptocurrencies/

In March, South Korea passed new legislation to strengthen the supervision of virtual assets. The new law, however, has resulted in pushback by banks and concerns that many of the altcoins and cryptocurrency exchanges that have sprung up in South Korea could be put out of business.
Under the new legislation ( ) all virtual asset management providers, which includes cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers, must register ( ) with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU) to operate in South Korea. The KFIU is the arm of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) responsible for anti-money laundering and exchanges would be required to report suspicious financial activity to it.
In order to register, exchanges are required to be certified by the Information Security Management System, ensure their customers have real name back accounts, and ensure that their CEO and board members have not been convicted of a crime. The law also requires exchanges to provide proof of adequate levels of deposit insurance ( ) to cover losses from hacks.
In January, South Korea also began enforcing a requirement that the name on cryptocurrency investors’ bank account match the name on their account at a cryptocurrency exchange in order to deposit money ( ) into their virtual wallets. With exchanges now required to ensure their customers have real name bank accounts, they are also required to partner with domestic banks ( ) to establish real name accounts for their clients.
South Korean banks, however, have been reluctant to partner ( ) with cryptocurrency exchanges as a result of negative comments by regulators on virtual assets and the risk of financial crimes on cryptocurrency exchanges. Instead banks are looking to limit their liability for cryptocurrencies as the government tightens regulation. They have asked the government to relieve them of liability ( ) for money laundering or other financial crimes on cryptocurrency exchanges.
The reluctance of banks to partner with cryptocurrency exchanges means that all but a few South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges could be forced out of business. To continue operating, exchanges need to partner with a South Korean bank, but with South Korean banks unwilling to take on the risk that comes from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges, they will be unable to register with the government or withdraw money ( ) for cryptocurrency trading after September 24.
The banking requirements under the new law are in line with recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force on virtual assets regarding know your own customer rules. These rules are designed to prevent money-laundering and other financial crimes. However, the prospect of closure for a number of exchanges has many considering suing ( ) the government and the FSC.
The deadline is also pushing cryptocurrency exchanges to take action. The top exchanges in South Korea have begun to delist or place warnings ( ) on virtual assets they deem to be risky. The step has also resulted in legal action. Upbit’s decision to delist 24 cryptocurrencies ( ) has resulted in a series of lawsuits against the cryptocurrency exchange.
Adding to the pressure on cryptocurrencies in South Korea, the government confirmed that it will move forward with a previously announced 20 percent capital gains tax ( ) on transactions in virtual assets next year. Seoul has also taken steps to prohibit exchange issued coins, and has begun to seize the crypto assets ( ) of tax dodgers. The Bank of Korea is also planning to initiate a pilot project ( ) for the development of central bank digital currency (CBDC), which could lessen the appeal of virtual assets.
The decision to strengthen regulations on virtual assets comes with good reasons. South Korea is estimated to account for 10 percent ( ) of global crypto transactions. The intensity of trading has seen cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin trade at a premium of 20 percent ( ) in South Korea, while 90 percent of trading is in altcoins.
The largely unregulated industry has been a source of both criminal activities and financial crimes. According to estimates by South Korean law enforcement agencies, cryptocurrency-related crimes have resulted in losses of $4.9 billion ( ) since 2017. They are also popular targets for North Korea’s financial crimes.
South Korea is not alone in tightening regulations on virtual assets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( ) has called for cryptocurrency to face the strongest capital rules of any asset. The Bank for International Settlements, which is made up of central banks, has noted that cryptocurrencies ( ) “work against the public good” and has raised concerns ( ) about the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and financial crimes. The EU is considering proposals ( ) to regulate cryptoassets, while the United States is calling for greater regulation of cryptoassets ( ) and will now require that transfers of $10,000 or more in cryptoassets to be reported to the IRS.
The U.S. and EU are not alone in taking stronger measures against virtual assets. China has banned the use of cryptocurrency for transactions and is cracking down on mining operations ( ). The U.K., Japan, and Germany ( ) have all halted activities or issued warnings about Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Bianance’s problems in the U.K. result from a 2022 decision to require cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the Financial Conduct Authority ( ) (FCA) and adhere to anti-money laundering rules. Ninety percent of cryptocurrency applicants in the U.K. have dropped their applications ( ) to register with the FCA rather than meet the anti-money laundering rules.
As virtual assets become more popular, they are increasingly coming under scrutiny by regulators to ensure that this new asset class does not become a haven for money laundering and financial crimes. As South Korea’s efforts to bring virtual assets into the mainstream regulatory infrastructure demonstrates, the process will be challenging, especially with banks reluctant to shoulder the burden of potential financial crime. The end result, however, will be a more transparent system that is safer for consumers.

https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/rbi-lost-case-on-cryptocurrency-in-supreme-court-it-must-stop-behaving-like-sore-loser-4196594.html

Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das recently said that the RBI has conveyed its “serious and major concerns” over virtual currencies (VCs) to the government. The so-called concerns over cryptocurrency are misplaced at best and smack of the central bank’s statist approach at worst.
On May 31 this year, the RBI had directed banks not to cite its 2018 ban as a reason to deny banking services to customers dealing in cryptocurrency. “It has come to our attention through media reports that certain entities have cautioned their customers against dealing in virtual currencies” by making a reference to the ban it had imposed, an RBI circular said.
So, it took almost a year for the RBI to realize, and that too from media reports, that the entities regulated by it still regarded virtual currencies as proscribed. This is surely not a mark of the banking regulator’s efficiency.
It directed the banks that following the apex court order, the earlier circular proscribing virtual currencies was no longer valid. The circular went on to add, “Banks, as well as other entities addressed above, may, however, continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002, in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances.”
Banks continued to caution their customers against dealing in cryptocurrencies because the RBI, despite the SC verdict, has persistently campaigned against the innovation. In the last week of February this year, Das raised concerns over VCs. The next month he again said the RBI had major concerns. Then again in June. His opposition to cryptocurrency seems to be the zeal of an activist rather than the reservation of a statutory regulator regarding an issue.
So, the RBI remains hostile towards and suspicious of cryptocurrencies, which are digitally encrypted, decentralized, and not regulated by any central bank or government. Right from the beginning of cryptocurrencies in the 1980s, its votaries were anti-establishment activists whose distrust of central banks as well as governments was libertarian-like.
As one of them, Adam Back, wrote: “What we want is fully anonymous, ultra-low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going … the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become.”
The parent of the first successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a mysterious, unknown figure by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. He is said to have sent an e-mail in August 2008 to Adam Back, along with an attachment, a white paper.
According to Satoshi, “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”
He and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts overcame the problem by bypassing all central banks and governments. Bitcoin was born and became hugely successful, attracting billions of dollars in the last few years.
Yet, as evident from Das’ recent salvo at virtual currencies, the central bank is unwilling to accept this development. This does not show him and the RBI in a good light; the central bank starts looking like a Luddite, instinctively hostile to innovation. And like a control freak that can’t accept anything it can’t control (the government’s approach was similar to that of the RBI. It once planned a law to ban VCs). This is not much different from the Chinese attitude. It may be noted that China proscribes VCs.
On the other hand, many major democracies, such as the US, Canada and the UK, allow the use of Bitcoin. Even the tiny Latin American nation El Salvador with a population of 6.5 million, recently accepted Bitcoin as legal tender.
It is not that the RBI has nothing important to do. “Gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) on retail and MSME loan books of public sector banks rose to 7.28 per cent in June 2021 from about 6 per cent a year ago. The incidence of bad loans was lower for private banks with GNPAs at 3.32 per cent in June, up from 2.01 per cent year ago, according to CARE Ratings,” says a Business Standard report.
Another report in The Indian Express says, “Public sector banks are experiencing a sharp surge in the proportion of Mudra loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) following the impact of COVID on incomes and repayment capacity of borrowers, according to bankers and an analysis of available data from state-level bankers’ committees.”
Then there is the issue of bank privatization, something urgently needed but, if it happens, will be hugely controversial. The good news is that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made her government’s intentions clear over the subject. A couple of weeks ago, she said, “During the budget, a public enterprise policy was announced, wherein we had identified certain strategically important sectors and in them, the bare minimum presence of the government will be there. Banks, financial institutions, and insurance are identified as strategic sectors, which means the government’s minimum presence will be there in insurance.”
Then there is a great deal that India has to do in the realm of financial inclusion. The recently unveiled RBI’s annual Financial Inclusion (FI) Index shows the country at 53.9, where 100 is the full financial inclusion score.----




https://www.thehindu.com/business/future-of-cryptocurrency-in-india-continues-to-hang-in-the-balance/article34704676.ece

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 31 asked banks not to cite its 2018 order as a reason to deny banking services to customers who dealt in cryptocurrencies. It stated that its 2018 order was set aside by the Supreme Court in March this year and that it would be inappropriate for banks to cite the order any longer.
In April 2018, the RBI issued a circular instructing banks to make sure customers dealing in cryptocurrencies were not allowed access to banking services. The circular came after years of suspicion among RBI officials about the legitimacy of virtual currencies issued by private parties.
The central bank has repeatedly warned about the supposed risks that these unregulated private currencies pose to investors and the financial system. The 2018 circular was seen by many as an attempt to discourage citizens from purchasing cryptocurrencies. By barring banks from facilitating transactions involving cryptocurrencies, the RBI effectively banned any significant rupee investment in cryptocurrencies.
The Supreme Court in its judgment on Internet and Mobile Association of India vs. RBI in March overturned the RBI’s 2018 circular. The SC noted that in the absence of any legislative ban on the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies, the RBI cannot impose disproportionate restrictions on trading in these currencies. The court felt such restrictions would interfere with the fundamental right of citizens to carry out any trade that is deemed legitimate under the law.
Banks have been reluctant to let their customers deal in cryptocurrencies due to the uncertainty surrounding the legality. Meanwhile, the Centre is considering a proposal to impose an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. In 2017, it is worth noting, an inter-disciplinary committee set up by the Centre had recommended a ban on the trading and possession of cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrency sceptics say there is good reason to believe that governments around the world will eventually ban all cryptocurrencies. They argue that governments and their central banks will not allow the dilution of their monopoly power over money.
The Indian government has been giving conflicting signals on this matter. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March said that there won’t be a total ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. But the Centre soon plans to introduce the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which is said to contain provisions completely banning the use of all cryptocurrencies. The future of cryptocurrencies in India, thus, still hangs in the balance.----




https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/crypto/cryptocurrency-in-india-a-look-at-the-regulatory-journey-of-cryptocurrencies-7648767/

From an outright ban on cryptocurrencies in 2016 to an upcoming Bill for regulation—the government’s stance on digital assets has changed considerably over the past few years. The upcoming Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 ( ) is different from the earlier one – ‘Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019.’
While the older law sought to impose a complete ban on all crypto-related activities including mining, buying, holding, selling, and dealing, the new one will look to make a clear distinction when it comes to its often used categorisation as a currency.
Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) order banning banks from supporting crypto transactions, was reversed by the Supreme Court order of March 2020.
The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 is listed for introduction in Parliament’s Winter Session seeks to prohibit all “private cryptocurrencies” in India. However, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.
In 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular warning the public against the use of virtual currencies. The bank warned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks they are exposing themselves to.
But as banks continued to allow transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges — on February 1, 2017, RBI released another circular, reiterating its concerns with virtual coins. And by the end of 2017, a warning was issued by RBI and the finance ministry clarifying that virtual currencies are not a legal tender.
At the same time, two Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were filed in the Supreme Court, one asking for a ban on buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in India, the other asking for them to be regulated. In November, the government formed a committee to study issues around virtual currencies and propose actions.
In March 2018, the Central Board of Digital Tax (CBDT) submitted a draft scheme to the finance ministry for banning virtual currencies. A month later, the RBI issued a circular that restrained banks and financial institutions from providing financial services to virtual currency exchanges.
Former RBI deputy governor BP Kanungo and then Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Sushil Chandra voiced their opinions in favour of a ban on cryptocurrencies. Chandra said it creates “a chain of black money.” He also mentioned that searches conducted into exchanges dealing with virtual currencies had revealed that most uninformed people in interior places are being lured to buy it.
On April 6, 2018, RBI issues a circular asking commercial and co-operative banks, payments banks, small finance banks, NBFCs, and payment system providers from dealing in virtual currencies, or providing services to all entities which deal with crypto exchanges.
In April 2018, the finance ministry appointed-committee proposed a draft bill for the regulation of virtual currencies but did not recommend a ban. However, in February 2019 the committee proposed a fresh draft bill that recommended a blanket ban.
Meanwhile, in March 2020 a significant development took place. The Supreme Court of India lifted the curb on cryptocurrency imposed by RBI, which restricted banks and financial institutions from providing access to banking services to those engaged in transactions in crypto assets.
“A high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) constituted under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions to be taken in the matter recommended in its report that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by the state, will be prohibited in India,” Finance Minister Sitharaman said in Rajya Sabha on February 9.
Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur also informed Parliament that the government planned to bring a Bill on cryptocurrencies as the existing laws were deemed inadequate to deal with the issues concerning cryptocurrencies.
Further, a report revealed that India could propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government official told Reuters at the time.
Days after the report surfaced, in an interview on March 5, Sitharaman said she wants to foster innovation in crypto. “We want to make sure that there is a window available for all kinds of experiments which will have to take place in the crypto world,” she said during an interview on CNBC TV18. “We are not closing our minds.”
Further, in November 2021, the Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP ( ) member Jayant Sinha, met representatives of crypto ( ) exchanges, Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), among others, and came to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but regulated.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting on cryptocurrencies with senior officials ( ). The indications are that strong regulatory steps will probably be taken to deal with the issue.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly underlined its strong view against cryptocurrencies, ( ) saying these pose a serious threat to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country. It has also raised doubts on the number of investors trading on cryptocurrencies and their claimed market value.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated his opposition to cryptocurrencies, saying these pose a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks. The RBI announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, about which the central bank has had many concerns.
Sitharaman Tuesday termed cryptocurrency as a “risky area” ( ) while speaking in the Rajya Sabha. She said that they are yet to take a call on advertisements around cryptocurrency. The statement comes a day after she was quoted as saying in the Lok Sabha that there was no proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in the country.
“This is a risky area and not in a complete regulatory framework. No decision was taken on banning its advertisements. Steps are taken to create awareness through RBI and SEBI. The government will soon introduce a Bill,” Sitharaman said during the Question Hour in Rajya Sabha.

On March 4, the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ban on cryptocurrency transactions. The RBI had imposed this ban since April 2018, which curbed a wide range of cryptocurrency based activity in India. Now, with this verdict, investors in cryptocurrencies and exchanges that allow trading in them have got a new life. Will this work in favour for both? Moneycontrol spoke to three crypto currency experts to get their views.
It is a mixed-bag of risk and rewards. Savvy investors track technological advances to reap benefits. However, it is equally important to be educated and aware – as an economy, a crypto-exchange, a trader or a consumer – to build a broader ecosystem where innovation thrives, and threats are mitigated. Cryptocurrencies gained acceptability, but they need to be seen as a double-edged sword in today’s volatile, risk-averse environment. For instance, there is a no central authority to regulate, take ownership or provide security to safeguard crypto assets.
There is ease of use and making transactions on a real-time basis, with no cross-border restrictions. Anonymity is offered, but there is virtually no know-your-customer (KYC) requirement, which makes it a concern from a traceability point of view. One of the major issues is that crypto accounts can be used for illicit purposes that are impossible to track. This makes it worrisome. Creating a crypto wallet requires just an internet-enabled device. With limited information technology literacy, this can expose users to high-risk situations and make them potential targets for cyber criminals. The resurrection of cryptocurrencies will depend on how the ecosystem can grow while mitigating risks.
We need to initiate dialogue with the Indian policymakers and regulators and work towards creating a crypto regulatory framework in India. Recently, South Korea legalised crypto. Japan and Australia have a positive outlook towards crypto as well. More and more countries are setting up regulation for crypto now. Regulating crypto will be a huge win for India as it will lead to more blockchain-focused startups, more jobs, and more tax revenue for the government.
Crypto is a new-age asset class; we shouldn’t pit it against fiat currencies. Currency is just one of the many possible use-cases of crypto. Moreover, the financial action task force (FATF) guidelines clearly states that crypto is not a threat to the global economy, and can be regulated properly. FATF has, in fact, even submitted a crypto standard regulation report to G20 countries, and India is a G20 member. Both crypto and fiat can co-exist and, in fact, crypto can help banks solve the existing problems for millions of unbanked people.
Due to the note ban, Indians had to use peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms for transactions, but the banking channel will be even more successful as it's more convenient for users. It will make it very easy for Indians to start trading in crypto.
We've long believed that India will be one of the leading countries for cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption as a natural progression toward a cashless Indian economy. The Supreme Court's decision to support innovation by legalising bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is a major step in the right direction for both India's consumers and crypto businesses that want to serve them.
Not only will this decision expand the daily use of cryptocurrencies in India, it will also attract new talent and innovation that will support the country’s own blockchain and distributed ledger technology initiatives. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that runs on blockchain technology.
Countries that embrace public cryptocurrencies will attract talent and generate domestic technology advantages that will help them win the blockchain technology race. A recent example of this occurred in China, which partially relaxed regulations around cryptocurrency mining following President Xi’s speech announcing blockchain technology as a national priority.
India has developed a strong position in developing next-generation blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and this infusion of talent and enhanced regulatory clarity will only help Indian firms develop regional and global leadership positions.

Fearing financial instability, the Indian government is in talks over a bill that could see a ban on private cryptocurrencies while creating a framework to bring in an official digital currency by its central bank.
India hopes that a ban would pave the way for the Reserve Bank of India — the country's central bank — to gain control over digital money, despite concerns over the lack of advanced data protection laws.
The central bank has repeatedly warned cryptocurrency could pose "serious concerns on macroeconomic and financial stability," while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November said cryptocurrencies ( ) could "spoil our youth."
The market for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has surged significantly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns ( ) , when much of the country's population was forced to stay at home.
Bitcoin saw an average return on investment of 66% in November and — along with cryptocurrencies Mana, Dogecoin and Ethereum — traded the most in volume during the festive season of Diwali in early November.
Film and cricket stars have also endorsed homegrown crypto exchanges by fronting advertising campaigns for platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX, both of which have upped their social media campaigns.
But when speculation around the proposed cryptocurrency legislation began last month, prices of some of the most popular digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether nosedived by as much as 25% — momentarily.
"I am not worried about the political economy of crypto, because those can be tackled through efficient monetary and fiscal coordination. However, the concern is about the regulatory framework, which needs to be strengthened, especially in the cross-border transactions," Chakraborty told DW.
"Even keeping crypto as an asset is so speculative and volatile at this point, that it could dangerously see-saw the asset ownership landscape and impact the real economy," economist Indira Rajaraman told DW.----

2021 was a year full of buzz around cryptocurrency in India, apps coming up with private cryptocurrency(bitcoin), people investing in bitcoins, government twice was close to come up with a law banning all private cryptocurrency, but no material step was taken in this area. It becomes imperative to understand all about cryptocurrency and the article aims to give a detailed analysis on cryptocurrency, its challenges and the way forward.
A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange similar to a Rupee or any other currency. The difference is while a rupee or a dollar exists in a physical form which is a printed note, cryptocurrency is held in an electronic form based on a technology named blockchain. Blockchain is nothing but a decentralized ledger in an electronic form which contains “blocks” in other words transactions across a peer-to-peer network, which means without an involvement of a third party.
Bitcoin is the world’s best known cryptocurrency which is considered to be the largest in terms of market value followed by Ethereum. If we talk about how cryptocurrency works, it needs to be understood in the context of a fiat money (currency with authorized permission and regulation), for example a rupee is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India which ensures that the money in circulation is genuine and is recorded. In the context of a cryptocurrency, a chain of private computers execute this process and solve complex cryptographic puzzles, this is done to authenticate the transaction, this process is called mining.
To trade in cryptocurrency, one needs to first buy a cryptocurrency, there are two ways in which a cryptocurrency can be brought, firstly, you can buy crypto coin from someone and the second, is to mine your own cryptocurrency. Buying happens in either an exchange facilitated transaction or a peer-to-peer transaction. Talking in the context of India, the simplest way to trade in cryptocurrency is through one of the exchange and trading platforms which includes, WazirX, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber etc.
To trade in cryptocurrency by using INR, the user needs to register on one of the exchange platforms mentioned above, and complete a KYC process, then if the user is buying cryptocurrency for the very first time will need to load INR money in their wallet of their cryptocurrency exchange.
El Salvador has become the first country to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender, China on the other hand has imposed a complete ban on cryptocurrency. It becomes imperative to look at some of the other jurisdictions around the world and their regulatory framework regarding cryptocurrency.
In the United States, The federal government does not recognize cryptocurrency as a legal tender, the two major regulators i.e. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are playing catch up while regulating the digital currency market, their objectives are two fold, firstly, protecting the investing public and secondly, maintaining market stability.
In the United Kingdom, Her Majesty’s Revenue and customs department has not considered crypto assets as a currency. Furthermore, it has noted that cryptocurrency does not qualify to be any form of investment activity.
In Canada its regulator, Canada Revenue Authority (CRA) though does not recognize it as a fiat currency but treats it like a commodity used for payment and investment purposes and the same is subject to taxation.
Israel through its legislation, Supervision of Financial Services Law includes digital currency within the definition of financial assets. The Israel tax Authority demands 25% on profits made through exchange and trading of cryptocurrency.
India though has not come up with any policy or legislation either regulating or banning cryptocurrency, however, before the winter session of parliament last year there were conjectures that the government may come up with a law banning all private cryptocurrencies, but nothing concrete happened, which has led to uncertainty amongst investors in the Indian crypto market. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) though, has given some hints as to what would a regulatory framework on cryptocurrency in India look like.
The RBI is expected to come up with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) a digital currency that can be transacted using platforms based on blockchains and would be regulated by RBI. However, this is just a form of digital currency, but the broader question is what should be a comprehensive policy related to cryptocurrency? Mr. Hemant Batra ( ) a renowned public policy expert and a lawyer while speaking to Mumbai Uncensored has provided his detailed insight and expertise on the policy regarding cryptocurrency, he says, “public policy can be of two types, firstly, a policy which brings or initiates a reform in any sector or segment within the society and second, is a policy brought about to formalize a change which has already happened. The Indian cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment. India is absolutely ready to accept cryptocurrency with a regulatory system based on global requirements as per the guidelines issued by IMF (International Monetary Fund). Banning cryptocurrency will lead to damaging the financial statistics of all nations”
The next aspect is the challenges that cryptocurrency puts forth before the policy makers, these can be termed as “macro” consequence of cryptocurrency. First aspect is the challenge related to the monetary policy, former RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao speaking at a public forum has expressed his concerns on cryptocurrency and its impact on monetary policy according to him, cryptocurrency may erode central bank’s control over money supply, “Crypto is backed by algorithms and there is fear that the central bank might lose control over money supply and inflation management. There are also concerns that crypto will disrupt the monetary policy,” he said, “Crypto can jump capital controls; fiat money is linked to the reserve currency,” his indication was towards “stablecoins” whose value is tied to a fiat currency by maintaining equivalent reserves (“currency board” exchange rate regime).
The next challenge is fiscal, that is cryptocurrency being used as a tool for tax evasion as it would be very feasible for a crypto investor to invest his untaxed money in purchasing bitcoins and similar would be a case in money laundering wherein “proceeds of crime” could easily be invested in any of the cryptocurrency exchange and trading platforms. Mr. Batra on this point states, “FATF (Financial Action task force) and IMF have expressed their serious concern about this issue, there are certain sets of cryptocurrency that are based on very private blockchains wherein one cannot identify the nation from which such virtual currency is operating and there are cases investigated globally wherein there has been a direct link between financing illegal and terror activities through crypto exchanges. To tackle this scenario, the government has to introduce regulatory regimes not on the cryptocurrency but crypto service providers.”
On the point of cryptocurrency being a very lucrative investment avenue Mr. Batra says, “investment in government bonds and securities, SEBI controlled mutual funds, financial securities might take a hit as people will not take risk in investing smaller companies and thus, they will either invest in blue chip companies or in cryptos”. Thus, cryptocurrency in India has now become a major factor in the financial as well as the economic realm and now what is needed is a comprehensive regulatory framework which ensures investor protection as well as market stability of crypto. In the budget session scheduled to start from 30 th January; the Union Budget will be presented on February 1st, the government is expected to come up with a law on cryptocurrency, it would be very interesting to see how the law is formulated.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted liberty to Future Retail Ltd (FRL) to move the Delhi High Court for seeking nod to proceed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) permission of going ahead with the Rs 24,731 crore merger deal with Reliance Retail.
“We grant liberty to FRL to approach the Delhi High Court for seeking continuation of proceedings before the NCLT…We request the single judge (of the high court) to pass orders”, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said.
Prior to this, in February 2021, SC had prevented the NCLT from taking a final call on the deal between Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd and Reliance Retail, even as it allowed the tribunal to go ahead with the proceedings for merger of Future group and Reliance group firms.
The apex court’s decision to overturn the HC’s 8 February ruling that lifted a freeze on the deal and allowing the NCLT to grant its approval based on merits was a positive for Amazon, which is keen to scuttle the deal.
Amazon had secured an interim stay on the deal from a Singapore arbitration tribunal in October, over alleged violation of a partnership contract by Future Group when it agreed to sell the assets to Reliance.
Pocket money and piggy banks have been used for years to impress upon the children the importance of managing money. However, this practice is usually done with teenagers and with very little to support this learning. Children learn about the transactory value of money very early on in their lives. So why do parents wait to teach them about money? The age-old argument about preserving their innocence doesn’t quite cut it. They’re already learning about money from their environment, if not implicitly. By introducing the topic, parents are not taking away any innocence but providing context to what they are already seeing all around them.
Children at an early age learn the art of decision making. This affects them in every sphere of life and is set at an early age. It would be helpful to guide this learning when the child is impressionable and still developing these core habits.
These values are very important in anyone’s life. They affect all types of decision making and can cause severe life changes. Hence, the need to enforce these values early on and set the right foundation for the future.
Many parents feel like this conversation is too stressful to bring up with their little one. However, this stress is felt by the adults who are struggling with the issue, not the child intent on learning everything about the world around them.
Money is an integral part of life which affords us the right education, a good environment and social security. Therefore, money management is not a life skill that should be ignored or put off. So when is the right time to start impressing the right values about money? Right when a child stops putting it in their mouth!
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not tinker with the personal income tax rates in the Budget for 2022-23. The minister also did not raise standard deduction, which was widely anticipated in view of elevated inflammation levels and impact of the pandemic on the middle class. The standard deduction currently stands at Rs 50,000.
There was no change in income tax slabs in the personal income tax category in the Budget unveiled on Tuesday, February 1. The corporate tax rate too was kept at the same level. However, the concessional rate of 15% has been extended by one year for newly incorporated manufacturing units.
In Union Budget 2020, the Union government had introduced reduced tax slabs with a clause that those opting for this will not be able to claim deductions. As per the tax regime, those earning upto Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay any income tax. Those earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh were taxed at 10%, between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh per year at 15%, between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12.5 lakh at 20%, between Rs 12.5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh at 25%, and above that at 30%.
However, if individuals wanted to claim deductions, they could continue to do so under the old regime. The old regime dictated that there would be no tax upto Rs 2.5 lakh, 5% between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, 20% between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, and 30% for those earning above Rs 10 lakh. Under the proposal, which system would be beneficial to people, was determined on their earnings and the investments they made.----




https://asiatimes.com/article/bank-of-thailand-to-launch-its-own-crypto-currency/amp/

Central banks’ antagonism towards crypto-currencies is well established. Banks profit from charging customers for transactions and services, but decentralized currencies cut out the need for the middle man – the banks. This allows crypto users to do business more efficiently and at significantly reduced cost.
However, increasingly, even central banks are coming around to understanding the advantages that a blockchain based currency can bring. The latest to make an announcement to that effect is the Bank of Thailand (BoT), which says it will launch its own version by the first quarter of 2019.
This week the Bangkok Post ( ) reported that the new virtual currency will be called, rather unimaginatively, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The BoT says that it, alongside eight commercial banks, will develop and test a proof-of-concept prototype for domestic fund transfers using the new crypto-currency.
According to the Bangkok Post, the eight participating banks are Bangkok Bank, Krungthai Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Kasikornbank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thanachart Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Thai and HSBC.
For their operating platform the banks have selected database firm R3, a centralized blockchain option as opposed to a decentralized platform such as Ethereum. New York City-based R3 has developed its own enterprise level distributed ledger platform, Corda, which will be used for the Thai bank’s digital currency.
“Technological changes are having a major impact on financial services,” the central bank said. “The Bank of Thailand and local financial institutions agreed to launch a project to raise technological readiness in adopting new financial technologies to enhance operational efficiencies. Creating an ecosystem conducive for collaborative learning in technology will be an important driving force towards a digital future.”
Following an uncertain start to 2018 with a number of proposed tax clampdowns, Thailand’s military regime has increasingly warmed to the crypto industry and now appears to be taking the Singaporean and South Korean model of crypto adoption rather than the draconian Chinese one.
The Thai government has worked on a regulatory framework ( ) which favors crypto exchanges and last week the SEC announced ( ) that seven exchanges have been approved for legal operations. Earlier this month the SEC revealed that over 50 ICO projects were becoming interested in operating in the Kingdom as more clarity in the associated regulations came to light.

https://www.thestreet.com/story/14541510/1/whats-behind-bitcoin-price-slump.html

Down nearly 40% year to date ( ) , Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market's chief barometer, continued its decline relative to the U.S. dollar heading into early April. While a few bullish hints are on the horizon, further consolidation appears likely as investors look to "de-risk" in other markets that affect cryptocurrency prices. Why the recent weakness?
Almost all economists agree that trade wars aren't good for the global economy, even if they benefit local economies in the short run. Markets face heightened uncertainty, too, as investors attempt to guess when and where retaliation is likely to occur.
A classic trade war has unfolded between the United States and other countries as the Trump administration added tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) in March and the People's Republic of China responded with tariffs of up to 25% on pork, wine, fruit, and nuts in a menu of 128 affected U.S. exports.
While President Trump has offered up a myriad of rationales behind the tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross summarized the White House's position as one that takes aim at unfairness and cited national security as the principal reason for the tariffs. In response, China's Ministry of Commerce warned of a "firm and necessary" response and asked that the tariffs be withdrawn "as soon as possible so that the trading of products between China and the United States will return to a normal track."
The "firm and necessary" language spooked investors into a predictable "de-risking" trade and as that relates to currencies, investors fled to the U.S. dollar. While some investors now view cryptocurrencies as a safe haven alternative, most see it as a risky bet on an emerging technology in a volatile and relatively illiquid market ( ).
However, bullish cryptocurrency investors remain resolute, with investor Tim Draper explaining that he thinks "Bitcoin is not volatile at all[;] all the fiat currencies are volatile by comparison as they fall away and down as they struggle to justify their existence in the face of the power and flexibility and ubiquity of Bitcoin."
Newer token and coin sales, many of which marketed themselves successfully on social media platforms and popular search engines faced additional headwinds as Google and Twitter banned new "initial coin offering" or "ICO" ads. ICOs, a means of fundraising for new cryptocurrencies ( ) and a play on the equity market's initial public offering terminology, has so far been a successful albeit controversial means of funding for many blockchain-technology based startups.
Startups raised nearly $6 billion from ICOs in 2017 with digital advertising as a key way to reach potential investors. In March, Alphabet's ( *GOOGL ( )* ) - Get Alphabet Inc. Class A Report ( ) Google -- through its network of Google Adwords partners -- said it would terminate ICO advertising in June. Meanwhile, Twitter ( *TWTR ( )* ) - Get Twitter, Inc. Report ( ) , Facebook ( *FB ( )* ) - Get Meta Platforms Inc. Class A Report ( ) , Snapchat ( *SNAP ( )* ) - Get Snap, Inc. Class A Report ( ) , Microsoft's ( *MSFT ( )* ) - Get Microsoft Corporation Report ( ) LinkedIn and most recently the email marketing engine, MailChimp, have all targeted marketing initiatives that included ICOs.
In a public statement, MailChimp wrote that it "cannot allow businesses involved in any aspect of the sale, transaction, exchange, storage, marketing or production of cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an Initial Coin Offering, to use MailChimp to facilitate or support any of those activities."
With direct digital marketing efforts curtailed, crypto marketing dollars will have to look elsewhere, including grass roots efforts to raise funds. Adryenn Ashley, a crypto-influencer and ICO consultant, predicts that "we'll see fewer scam coins and more of an effort to earn the trust of the community rather than buy it."
The SEC, whose mandate is to promote and enforce regulations around markets and trading, said last year that cryptocurrency markets are afforded "substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets." As a result, it's reiterated the need for a stronger, cohesive regulatory framework along with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, and has issued subpoenas to dozens of companies that offered marketed ICOs in the past few years.
In a recent Fox Business interview, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that "we have seen instances where companies seem to have had trouble raising money in a traditional private placement and then have switched to an ICO in order to raise the money. The business hasn't changed substantively, but it's a form-over-substance way to raise money. That is troubling."

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/twitter-ban-cryptocurrency-adverts-regulators-bitcoin-facebook-social-media-a8277176.html

A growing number of internet companies are banning cryptocurrency ( ) advertising, fearing reputational damage if their users are duped or left penniless, even as regulators struggle to get to grips with the fast-emerging industry.
Huge billboards promoting the latest coin hang over Tokyo’s streets, ads touting crypto-trading dot the London Underground, and social media platforms are full of startups looking to raise capital through “initial coin offerings” (ICOs), as the selling of new virtual tokens is known.
While regulators have stepped up their warnings about the risks to consumers of investing in cryptocurrencies and the potential for scams, in most jurisdictions they are only beginning to discuss publicly how they might regulate the industry, let alone frame advertising rules.
“If internet companies were not already under pressure from regulators for their lose control of data privacy, they probably would not ban advertising from cryptos, which are still a grey area for many regulators,” says Arnaud Masset, a crypto-currency analyst at Swissquote bank.
The country’s financial watchdog, meanwhile, has asked the crypto industry’s new self-regulatory body to draw up advertising rules. It has not stipulated what it wants to see but it is likely that Japanese exchanges will not be allowed to mention specific currencies when advertising, while TV promotions for ICOs could be banned altogether, a source familiar with the matter said.
The slump in virtual currency prices this year has not rattled British punters lured in by adverts, however: a spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority said it had to date received fewer than 10 complaints about crypto ads.
Christie Dennehy-Neil at the Internet Advertising Bureau, a UK trade body, says large online platforms often introduce policies that take “a judgment more broadly than advertising” to protect their reputation.
She says that the ideal case “would be for a product to be regulated and for there to be sector-specific rules for advertising”. But without regulation in place, companies are sensible to act on their own accord, she says.----




https://www.zdnet.com/article/bitcoin-gold-delisted-from-major-cryptocurrency-exchange-after-refusing-to-pay-hack-damages/

Bittrex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, has delisted Bitcoin Gold (BTG) from its trading platform over the weekend after BTG maintainers declined to pay half of the damages Bittrex suffered during a complex multi-stage cyber-attack earlier this year.
BTG maintainers said they did all that was possible on their end to help trading platforms prevent the attacks, but they did not have the legal power to intervene inside a private company like Bittrex.
BTG experts said hackers rented servers through the NiceHash cryptocurrency mining market to overwhelm the Bitcoin Gold network and take control of more than half the BTG network computational hashrate.
Once funds were converted and stolen, hackers would then use their 51% control over the BTG network to reverse the initial BTG deposit, invalidating the transaction and returning their original Bitcoin Gold funds to their personal wallets. This second stage is what's known as a double-spend attack.
At the time, BTG maintainers repeatedly warned ( ) cryptocurrency trading platforms to raise transaction confirmation thresholds, a solution that would have made it more costly for attackers to mount a 51% attack.
The BTG maintainers also warned ( ) trading platforms about the attacker's wallet address, telling them to refuse any incoming BTG deposits, and hence preventing the more devastating double-spend attack even if the 51% attack was successful.
Back in May, cryptocurrency experts said hackers successfully used this dual 51% & double-spend attack to steal over 388,000 BTG coins (worth over $18 million at the time) from several cryptocurrency exchanges, but they did not reveal which platforms suffered losses during the attacks.
But according to a statement ( ) published over the weekend by the BTG team, the only platform that didn't follow normal practices was Bittrex, who, in an unprecedented move, tried to convince the BTG maintainers to pay for a hack's losses.
Something like this has never happened before, and the BTG team didn't want to hear it. Bittrex tried to meet BTG maintainers in the middle, but the BTG team also declined to pay a halved reparations fee of roughly 6,000 BTG coins (~$126,000).
Following the failure to strike an agreement, Bittrex delisted Bitcoin Gold trading options on Saturday, September 1, telling BTG maintainers they reached their final decision after the BTG team did not take a part of the responsibility for the hack.

https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework

Attorney General William P. Barr announced today the release of “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,” a publication produced by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital Task Force.  The Framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency; details the important relationships that the Department of Justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the United States government and around the world; and outlines the Department’s response strategies.
“Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society.  Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies,” said Attorney General Barr.  “I am grateful to the Cyber-Digital Task Force for producing this detailed report, which provides a cohesive, first-of-its kind framework for those seeking to understand federal enforcement priorities in this growing space.”
“At the FBI, we see first-hand the dangers posed when criminals bend the important technological promise of cryptocurrency to illicit ends," said FBI Director Christopher Wray.   “As this Enforcement Framework describes, we see criminals using cryptocurrency to try to prevent us from 'following the money’ across a wide range of investigations, as well as to trade in illicit goods like criminal tools on the dark web. For example, the cyber criminals behind ransomware attacks often use cryptocurrency to try to hide their true identities when acquiring malware and infrastructure, and receiving ransom payments. The men and women of the FBI are constantly innovating to keep pace with the evolution of criminals' use of cryptocurrency."
“The United States has been enormously successful blocking terrorists, rogue regimes, and their supporters from funding their activity using traditional currencies,” said Task Force member John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.  “As the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework explains, we will adapt our strategy and tools to 21st century financing, including to combat the use of cryptocurrencies to evade enforcement and harm our national security.”
“Cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology present tremendous promise for the future, but it is critical that these important innovations follow the law.  The Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework provides the public with important information intended to help them understand and comply with their obligations under the legal regimes that govern these new and fast-developing technologies,” said Task Force member Brian C. Rabbitt, the acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division.  “While the Department of Justice and its partners are committed to supporting the advancement of legitimate cryptocurrency technologies and uses, we will not hesitate to enforce the laws that govern these technologies when necessary to protect the public.”
Task Force member Beth A. Williams, who serves as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy, lauded the release of the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework:  “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the public from current and emerging cyber threats, including those involving cryptocurrency and related technologies.  This Framework reflects the Department’s extensive cooperation with domestic and international partners in ensuring that we are adequately addressing these challenges, to the benefit of lawful cryptocurrency users and the public at large.”
Then, in Part I, the Framework provides a detailed threat overview, cataloging the three categories into which most illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall: (1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; and (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.
Part II explores the various legal and regulatory tools at the government’s disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency’s illicit uses, and highlights the strong and growing partnership between the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Commission, and agencies within the Department of the Treasury, among others, to enforce federal law in the cryptocurrency space.
Finally, the Enforcement Framework concludes in Part III with a discussion of the ongoing challenges the government faces in cryptocurrency enforcement—particularly with respect to business models (employed by certain cryptocurrency exchanges, platforms, kiosks, and casinos), and to activity (like “mixing” and “tumbling,” “chain hopping,” and certain instances of jurisdictional arbitrage) that may facilitate criminal activity.
The Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework is the second detailed report issued by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, which was established in February 2018 to answer two basic questions:  How is the Department of Justice responding to global cyber threats?  And how can federal law enforcement accomplish its mission in this area more effectively?  An earlier Task Force report, published in July 2018, canvassed a wide spectrum of cyber threats, ranging from transnational criminal enterprises’ sophisticated cyber-enabled schemes, to malign foreign influence operations, to efforts to compromise our nation’s critical infrastructure, and articulated the Department’s priorities in detecting, deterring, and disrupting cyber threats.
Additional Cyber-Digital Task Force members include Andrew E. Lelling, United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and two senior FBI executives.  Components from across the Department contributed to the Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework’s drafting.----




https://www.natlawreview.com/article/doj-releases-cryptocurrency-enforcement-report

On October 8, 2020, the Department of Justice’s Cyber-Digital Task Force released an 83-page report ( ) entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework.” In an accompanying press release ( ) , Attorney General Barr remarked, “Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society.  Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies.” The DOJ report highlights many of the legal and enforcement risks posed in the burgeoning crypto marketplace, and includes various enforcement case studies as well as informative graphics.
After an introductory essay by the chair of the Cyber-Digital Task Force, the report is organized into three parts. Part I begins with a brief survey of “legitimate” commercial uses for cryptocurrency, then describes three categories into which the DOJ believes most illicit uses of cryptocurrency typically fall. These illicit uses include (1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes or in support of terrorism; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; and (3) direct commission of crimes, such as theft and fraud, that implicate the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.
Part II discusses various legal and regulatory techniques the government deploys to confront illicit uses of cryptocurrency. It also highlights the increased cooperation among the Department of Justice and other government agencies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and various units within the Department of the Treasury, to enforce federal laws in the cryptocurrency space.
Part III concludes with a discussion of the ongoing challenges the government faces in cryptocurrency enforcement. In particular, the report focuses on certain business models employed by some cryptocurrency exchanges, peer-to-peer platforms, crypto kiosks, and virtual casinos, as well as activities such as  “mixing” and “tumbling,” “chain hopping,” and “jurisdictional arbitrage” that the DOJ believes may facilitate criminal activity.  It also describes the government’s multi-faceted enforcement response.

Illicit activities like cybercrime, money laundering and terrorist financing made up only 0.15% of all crypto transactions conducted in 2021, according to a new report ( ) from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform.
*Yes, but:* Crypto crime is at an all-time high in absolute terms, the report found. It's just that the growth rate of legitimate activity far outpaced the growth rate for illicit activity, Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis, tells Axios.
*Worth noting:* Chainalysis acknowledges that the data could change with additional information. Last year, it reported that illicit activity made up 0.34% of 2020 crypto transaction volume, but revised that number upward to 0.62%.

But those numbers don’t tell the full story. Cryptocurrency usage is growing faster than ever before. Across all cryptocurrencies tracked by Chainalysis, total transaction volume grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, up 567% from 2020’s totals. Given that roaring adoption, it’s no surprise that more cybercriminals are using cryptocurrency. But the fact that the increase was just 79% — nearly an order of magnitude lower than overall adoption — might be the biggest surprise of all.
Transactions involving illicit addresses represented just 0.15% of cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021 despite the raw value of illicit transaction volume reaching its highest level ever. As always, we have to caveat this figure and say that it is likely to rise as Chainalysis identifies more addresses associated with illicit activity and incorporates their transaction activity into our historical volumes. For instance, we found in our last Crypto Crime Report ( ) that 0.34% of 2020’s cryptocurrency transaction volume was associated with illicit activity — we’ve now raised that figure to 0.62%. Still, the yearly trends suggest that with the exception of 2019 — an extreme outlier year for cryptocurrency-based crime largely due to the PlusToken Ponzi scheme ( ) — crime is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Law enforcement’s ability to combat cryptocurrency-based crime is also evolving. We’ve seen several examples of this throughout 2021, from the CFTC filing charges ( ) against several investment scams, to the FBI’s takedown ( ) of the prolific REvil ransomware strain, to OFAC’s sanctioning of Suex ( ) and Chatex ( ) , two Russia-based cryptocurrency services heavily involved in money laundering.
However, we also have to balance the positives of the growth of legal cryptocurrency usage with the understanding that $14 billion worth of illicit activity represents a significant problem. Criminal abuse of cryptocurrency creates huge impediments for continued adoption, heightens the likelihood of restrictions being imposed by governments, and worst of all victimizes innocent people around the world. In this report, we’ll explain exactly how and where cryptocurrency-based crime increased, dive into the latest trends amongst different types of cybercriminals, and tell you how cryptocurrency businesses and law enforcement agencies around the world are responding. But first, let’s look at a few of the key trends in cryptocurrency-based crime.
Let’s start with scams. Scamming ( ) revenue rose 82% in 2021 to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total — which is nearly equal to the increase over 2020’s total — came from rug pulls, a relatively new scam type in which developers build what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects — meaning they do more than simply set up wallets to receive cryptocurrency for, say, fraudulent investing opportunities — before taking investors’ money and disappearing. Please keep in mind as well that these figures for rug pull losses represent only the value of investors’ funds that were stolen, and not losses from the DeFi tokens’ subsequent loss of value following a rugpull.
We should note that roughly 90% of the total value lost to rug pulls in 2021 can be attributed to one fraudulent centralized exchange, Thodex, whose CEO disappeared soon after the exchange halted users’ ability to withdraw funds. However, every other rug pull tracked by Chainalysis in 2021 involved DeFi projects. In nearly all of these cases, developers have tricked investors into purchasing tokens associated with a DeFi project before draining the tools provided by those investors, sending the token’s value to zero in the process.
We believe rug pulls are common in DeFi for two related reasons. One is the hype around the space. DeFi transaction volume has grown 912% in 2021, and the incredible returns on decentralized tokens like Shiba Inu ( ) have many excited to speculate on DeFi tokens. At the same time, it’s very easy for those with the right technical skills to create new DeFi tokens and get them listed on exchanges, even without a code audit. A code audit is a process by which a third-party firm or listing exchange analyzes the code of the smart contract behind a new token or other DeFi project, and publicly confirms that the contract’s governance rules are iron clad and contain no mechanisms that would allow for the developers to make off with investors’ funds. Many investors could likely have avoided losing funds to rug pulls if they’d stuck to DeFi projects that have undergone a code audit – or if DEXes required code audits before listing tokens.
Cryptocurrency theft grew even more, with roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021 — a 516% increase compared to 2020. Roughly $2.3 billion of those funds — 72% of the 2021 total — were stolen from DeFi protocols. The increase in DeFi-related thefts represents the acceleration of a trend we identified ( ) in last year’s Crypto Crime report.
In 2020, just under $162 million worth of cryptocurrency was stolen from DeFi platforms, which was 31% of the year’s total amount stolen. That alone represented a 335% increase over the total stolen from DeFi platforms in 2019. In 2021, that figure rose another 1,330%. In other words, as DeFi has continued to grow, so too has its issue with stolen funds. As we’ll explore in more detail later in the report, most instances of theft from DeFi protocols can be traced back to errors in the smart contract code governing those protocols, which hackers exploit to steal funds, similar to the errors that allow rug pulls to occur.
We’ve also seen significant growth in the usage of DeFi protocols for laundering illicit funds, a practice we saw scattered examples of in 2020 and that became more prevalent in 2021. Check out the graph below, which looks at the growth in illicit funds received by different types of services in 2021 compared to 2020.
DeFi is one of the most exciting areas of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, presenting huge opportunities to entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency users alike. But DeFi is unlikely to realize its full potential if the same decentralization that makes it so dynamic also allows for widespread scamming and theft. One way to combat this is better communication — both the private and public sectors have an important role to play in helping investors learn how to avoid dubious projects. In the longer term, the industry may also need to take more drastic steps to prevent tokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges.
One promising development in the fight against cryptocurrency-related crime is the growing ability of law enforcement to seize illicitly obtained cryptocurrency. In November 2021, for instance, the IRS Criminal Investigations announced ( ) that it had seized over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021 — all from non-tax investigations — representing 93% of all funds seized by the division during that time period. We’ve also seen several examples of successful seizures by other agencies, including $56 million seized ( ) by the Department of Justice in a cryptocurrency scam investigation, $2.3 million seized ( ) from the ransomware group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack, and an undisclosed amount seized by Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing ( ) in a case related to terrorism financing.
This raises an interesting question: How much cryptocurrency are criminals currently holding? It’s impossible to know for sure, but we can estimate based on the current holdings of addresses Chainalysis has identified as associated with illicit activity. As of early 2022, illicit addresses hold at least $10 billion worth of cryptocurrency, with the vast majority of this held by wallets associated with cryptocurrency theft. Addresses associated with darknet markets and with scams also contribute significantly to this figure. As we’ll explore later in this report, much of this value comes not from the initial amount derived from criminal activity, but from subsequent price increases of the crypto assets held.
We believe it’s important for law enforcement agencies to understand these estimates as they build out their blockchain-based investigative capabilities, and especially as they develop their ability to seize illicit cryptocurrency.
DeFi-related crime and criminal cryptocurrency balances are just one area of focus for this report. We’ll also look at the latest data and trends on other forms of cryptocurrency-based crime, including:
As cryptocurrency continues to grow, it’s imperative that the public and private sectors work together to ensure that users can transact safely, and that criminals can’t abuse these new assets. We hope that this report can contribute to that goal, and equip law enforcement, regulators, and compliance professionals with the knowledge to more effectively prevent, mitigate, and investigate cryptocurrency-based crime.

As if bitcoin fans didn’t have enough to worry about these days, a widely respected international bank has just published a scathing analysis of the cryptocurrency questioning whether it ever will be more than a fad — and a costly fad for its adherents.
The report by the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements ( ) doesn’t present any particularly novel questions about bitcoin and related virtual currencies. But it brings together all the existing questions and validates them, with facts and figures.
The BIS says its goal was to look “beyond the hype” of bitcoin. What it found was a currency-like system that can’t handle a scaling up of transactions, can’t provide the trustworthiness required for a functioning currency, and requires so much computing power to keep track of exchanges that it already has become “an environmental disaster.”
That’s just for starters. The BIS report, which is a chapter in the institution’s annual report, comes against a backdrop that includes a six-month price collapse, government enforcement actions against alleged cryptocurrency frauds and reports of hackings costing bitcoin owners the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars in the blink of an eye.
You can expect the bitcoin faithful to dismiss the BIS report as the incumbent central banking establishment trying to bring down a challenge to its primacy. It’s true that the bank is part of that establishment. Often described as the central bank for central banks ( ) , the BIS acts as a counterparty and agent for central banks in their transactions. But its duties also include policy analysis and research of interest to those member banks; producing an inaccurate or unfair analysis of a rival marketplace wouldn’t be much of a service for those members.
The BIS report includes a precis on the definition and role of money — worth a read by bitcoin fans and skeptics alike. As it observes, a functioning monetary system must comprise three features — a “unit of account” that allows price comparisons for goods and services, a medium of exchange accepted as payment by buyers and sellers alike, and a store of value that remains stable over time — the money in your bank account, wallet or mattress shouldn’t fluctuate widely.
No such systems are perfect, the BIS acknowledges. Indeed, the British Museum devotes a whole room to the stones, shells, coins, paper and other objects that once served all those three roles and fell out of favor. Nor is government-issued currency immune from abuse, as is plain from the experiences of the Weimar-era German mark and today’s debasement of the currency of Venezuela. But the central bank systems that sprung up in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were refined in the aftermath of the Great Depression were responses to such crises.
Bitcoin and other such instruments aspire to the three roles of money, but can’t deliver, BIS says. Although the systems ostensibly incorporate safeguards against counterfeiting, no central authority stands behind them as a trusted counterparty. Bitcoins’ value “derives only from the expectation that they will continue to be accepted by others,” BIS says. In this they resemble “commodity money” such as salt or rice--except that unlike those commodities, bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
Among the more damning findings of the BIS paper is the cost of injecting trust into the bitcoin system by vesting control of the bitcoin supply in the hands of “miners.” These are people or groups that use computers to verify and validate transactions via algorithms that, once solved, produce additional bitcoin supply for the miners (up to a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins).
That system is unsustainable, the BIS says. The electrical use devoted to mining bitcoin alone already equals that of Switzerland: “The quest for decentralized trust has quickly become an environmental disaster.”
There are other grounds to doubt whether bitcoin can grow large enough to serve financial transactions on anything like a global scale. For bitcoin to verify transactions on the scale of Visa or Mastercard systems today would require supercomputers and “communication volumes [that] could bring the internet to a halt.”
BIS acknowledges that some technologists believe that the technology underlying bitcoin, known as blockchain technology, could have more value for central banks or international financial systems than bitcoin itself. It’s skeptical. Tests by some central banks have experimented with such systems, successfully. “However,” it finds, “the results have not been clearly superior to existing infrastructures.”
The BIS report in itself may not shake the faith of the bitcoin faithful, whose commitment to the currency often rests in an anti-government ideology. Bitcoin remains hugely volatile — its price in dollars gained 4% Monday, according to the Coindesk service, though at about $6,700 it has lost about two-thirds of its peak of nearly $20,000 in mid-December.
BIS has done a service for finance professionals in providing a baseline judgment of whether bitcoin is worth serious consideration as an asset class at a time when investment banks such as Goldman Sachs are offering clients access to the market. The banks appear to be responding to their clients’ wishes. But whether they’re actually providing those clients with a worthwhile service is a different question, and BIS suggests the answer may be no.

Cryptocurrency’s warning signs having been coming fast and furious. A new report indicates that half of initial coin offerings, which are the crypto world’s money-raising equivalent of an IPO, have already died ( ) —and many of the remaining are blatant scams with no intent to build a product. Then there are the crypto-rich stories that shouldn’t pass a basic smell test of reasonability and logic. Just look at Ripple. In early January, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen had a net worth of $59 billion ( ) , moving him ahead of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founders of Google, and the founder of Oracle. But following a crypto crash in mid January, Larsen had lost $44 billion ( ) of his net worth. Gravity can be a heartache.
Then you have the mythology surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous listed inventor of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. A mysterious character who creates 880,000 bitcoins of dubious value whose value is propped up by a public enthralled by stories of newly minted crypto millionaires? That’s not going to end well. Throw in a twist where one person allegedly manipulated ( ) prices on the Mt. Gox currency exchange to drive the price from $150 to $1,000, and it all sounds like a Hollywood film. The red flags are right out there in the open, waving in the wind.
Despite the damn-the-man libertarian framing of cryptocurrency as the great democratizer of wealth, just 1,000 people own 40% ( ) of the entire bitcoin market (which was valued at over $200 billion ( ) in early 2018, and now hovers somewhere over $100 billion depending on the massive daily fluctuations).
Broadly defined, multi-level marketing schemes work by creating a structure where people are recruited and then incentivized to recruit new members. Nutritional-supplement seller Herbalife ( ) and cosmetics company Mary Kay ( ) are two prime examples. The more people who buy into the concept down the line, the more that the individuals at the top make, hence the closely related pyramid-scheme synonym. A participant’s livelihood therefore depends on recruiting new believers, and the proselytizers who were around from the early days deemphasize the associated risks. Eventually too many people try to join the bottom and the middle bricks begin falling out—but not before the early adopters are able to make an exorbitant amount of money.
Isn’t this exactly what is happening in the cryptocurrency world? Those who bought in early have an incredibly strong interest to recruit new “members”: The more people who buy crypto, the higher the prices become, and the thicker the owners’ digital wallets get. As the field goes mainstream, their current holdings will spike in value, especially given the fact that many cryptocurrencies trade with small volume. But eventually the hype will die down, and the latecomers will shoulder the brunt.
The thought of making easy money, especially after seeing others around you make money, triggers people to suspend their typical reasoning. Looking to capitalize on this moment of suspended logic, new cryptocurrencies are multiplying like Gremlins. There are currently 1,519 cryptocurrencies available to purchase ( ) , many of which are listed at well under a penny. (But if that penny goes up to a dime, someone makes a lot of money.)
Much like your essential-oil obsessive cousin who finally sees through their pyramid scheme’s shiny facade, a light is beginning to shine on crypto harpers. Respected investor and currency trader George Soros said at the recent World Economic Forum that “ bitcoin is not a currency ( ).” Likewise, Warren Buffet is skeptical: “I can say almost with certainty that [cryptocurrencies] will come to a bad ending,” he told CNBC ( ) in January. An EU Commission has just stated that cryptocurrencies are not a currency ( ) and do not have guaranteed value. Even the North American Bitcoin Conference stopped accepting bitcoin ( ) as payment to its own conference.
Yet true believers are still undeterred. We have seen this mass delusion play out before, and you don’t have to go back to the Tulip Mania ( ) of 1636-1637 to see it. The late 1990s featured a mania around Beanie Babies, where adults spent thousands of dollars ( ) for plush toys made in China. Their price continued to rise based on the belief that the Beanie Babies had turned into a new type of asset, and lots of people lost major savings ( ). But still, there was a winner: Creator Ty Warner is currently worth $2.7 billion ( ).
In a similar fashion, cryptocurrencies are minting millionaires and billionaires because they are convincing down-the-line participants that there is easy money at the end of the rainbow. The newness and complex technical nature of cryptocurrency masks a multilevel-marketing strategy we have seen perpetuated throughout history—except instead of slinging beauty products or protein powders, we’re now buying invisible coins.----




https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/22/the-prophets-of-cryptocurrency-survey-the-boom-and-bust

Not long ago, I was in Montreal for a cryptocurrency conference. My hotel, on the top floor of a big building downtown, had a roof garden with a koi pond. One morning, as I had coffee and a bagel in this garden, I watched a pair of ducks feeding on a mound of pellets that someone had left for them at the pond’s edge. Every few seconds, they dipped their beaks to drink, and, in the process, spilled undigested pellets into the water. A few koi idled there, poking at the surface for the scraps. The longer I watched, the more I wondered if the ducks were deliberately feeding the fish. Was such a thing possible? I asked the breakfast attendant, a ruddy Quebecer. He smiled and said, “No, but it is what I tell the children.”
My mind had been marinating overnight—and for more than a year, really—in the abstrusities of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology on which they are built. Bitcoin and, subsequently, a proliferation of other cryptocurrencies had become an object of global fascination, amid prophecies of societal upheaval and reform, but mainly on the promise of instant wealth. A peer-to-peer money system that cut out banks and governments had made it possible, and fashionable, to get rich by sticking it to the Man.
Some of this stuff I understood; much of it I still did not. If you’re not, say, a computer scientist or a mathematician, the deeper you get into the esoterica of distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, hash functions, zero-knowledge proofs, byzantine-fault-tolerance theory, and so on—the farther you travel from the familiar terrain of “the legacy world,” where, one blockchain futurist told me, pityingly, I live—the better the chance you have of bumping up against the limits of your intelligence. You grasp, instead, for metaphors.
Blockchain talk makes a whiteboard of the brain. You’re always erasing, starting over, as analogies present themselves. So, Montreal bagel in hand, I considered the ducks and the carp. Let the pellets be a cryptocurrency—koicoin, say. Would the ducks then be currency miners? Every altcoin—the catchall for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, the majority of which are eventually classified as shitcoin—has its own community of enthusiasts and kvetchers, so perhaps the koi were this one’s. The koicommunity. The breakfast attendant who had put out the pellets: he’d be our koicoin Satoshi—as in Satoshi Nakamoto ( ) , the pseudonymous and still unidentified creator of Bitcoin. Yes, the koicoin protocol was strong, and the incentives appeared to be well aligned, but the project didn’t really pass muster in terms of immutability, decentralization, and privacy. Koicoin was shitcoin.
A few hours later, I was at lunch in a conference room in another hotel, with a table of crypto wizards, a few of them among the most respected devs in the space. (Devs are developers, and even legacy worlders must surrender after a while and ditch the scare quotes around “the space,” when referring to the cryptosphere.) Four of these devs were researchers associated with Ethereum, the open-source blockchain platform. Ethereum is not itself a cryptocurrency; to operate on Ethereum, you have to use the cryptocurrency ether, which, like bitcoin, you can buy or sell. (Among cryptocurrencies, ether’s market capitalization is second only to bitcoin’s.) The devs were specimens of an itinerant coder élite, engaged, wherever they turn up and to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, in the ongoing construction of an alternate global financial and computational infrastructure: a new way of handling money or identity, a system they describe as a better, decentralized version of the World Wide Web—a Web 3.0—more in keeping with the Internet’s early utopian promise than with the invidious, monopolistic hellscape it has become. They want to seize back the tubes, and the data—our lives—from Facebook, Google, and the new oligarchs of Silicon Valley.
One of them, Vlad Zamfir, a twenty-eight-year-old Romanian-born mathematician who grew up in Ottawa and dropped out of the University of Guelph, was scribbling equations on an electronic tablet called a reMarkable pad. He narrated as he scrawled. The others at the table leaned in toward him, in a way that recalled Rembrandt’s “The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.” To the two or three people at the table who were clearly incapable of following along, he said, earnestly, “Sorry to alienate you with my math.” Zamfir is the lead developer of one strand of Casper, an ongoing software upgrade designed to make Ethereum scale better and work more securely—an undertaking thought to be vital to its viability and survival. “It’s shitty technology,” Zamfir, whose Twitter bio reads “absurdist, troll,” told a journalist two years ago.
Zamfir was showing the others some rough equations he’d worked out to address one of the thousands of riddles that need to be solved. This particular effort was an attempt (jargon alert) to optimize the incentive structure for proof-of-stake validation—that is, how best to get enough people and machines to participate in a computing operation essential to the functioning of the entire system. “We’re trying to do game theory here,” Zamfir said. The others pointed out what they thought might be flaws. “It doesn’t seem reasonable,” Zamfir said. “But the math works out.” This summarized much of what I’d encountered in crypto.
To his right sat Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s founder and semi-reluctant philosopher king. Buterin, who is twenty-four, occasionally glanced at Zamfir’s formulas but mostly looked into the middle distance with a melancholic empty stare, sometimes typing out messages and tweets on his phone with one finger. He was a quick study, and also he pretty much already knew what Zamfir had come up with, and to his thinking the work wasn’t quite there. “When the models are getting overcomplicated, it’s probably good to have more time to try to simplify them,” he told me later, with what I took to be generous understatement.
They had first met before a conference in Toronto in 2014. Zamfir was amazed by Buterin, whom he called a “walking computer,” and he joined Ethereum as a researcher soon after. Now good friends who meet up mostly at conferences and workshops, they had greeted each other the day before in the hotel lobby with a fervent embrace, like summer campers back for another year, before quick-walking to a quiet corner to start in on the incentive-structure-for-proof-of-stake-validation talk. Whenever and wherever Buterin and Zamfir convene, people gather around—eavesdropping, hoping for scraps of insight. The two are used to this and pay little heed. There were no secrets, only problems and solutions, and the satisfaction that comes from proceeding from one toward the other.
The first time I heard the word “Ethereum” was in April, 2017. A hedge-fund manager, at a benefit in Manhattan, was telling me that he’d made more money buying and selling ether and other cryptocurrencies in the past year than he’d ever made at his old hedge fund. This was a significant claim, since the fund had made him a billionaire. He was using words I’d never heard before. He mentioned bitcoin, too, which I’d certainly heard a lot about but, like most people my age, didn’t really understand. I’d idly hoped I might be just old enough to make it to my deathbed without having to get up to speed.
As the year wore on, that dream faded. The surge in the price of bitcoin, and of other cryptocurrencies, which proliferated amid a craze for initial coin offerings (I.C.O.s), prompted a commensurate explosion in the number of stories and conversations about this new kind of money and, sometimes more to the point, about the blockchain technology behind it—this either revolutionary or needlessly laborious way of keeping track of transactions and data. It seemed as if language had been randomized. I started hearing those words—the ones I’d never heard before—an awful lot: “trustless,” “sharding,” “flippening.” Explaining blockchain became a genre unto itself.
The dizzying run-up in crypto prices in 2017 was followed, this year, by a long, lurching retreat that, as the summer gave way to fall, began to seem perilous. As with notorious stock-market and real-estate bubbles, innocents had been taken in and cleaned out. But both boom and bust reflected an ongoing argument over what cryptocurrencies and their technological underpinnings might be worth—which is to say, whether they are, as some like to ask, real. Is crypto the future or a fad? Golden ticket or Ponzi scheme? Amazon 2.0 or tulip mania? And what is it good for, anyway? It sure is neat, but for now it lacks its killer app, a use that might lead to mass adoption, as e-mail did for the Internet. “We need the hundred-dollar laptop, the iPod,” a blockchain apostle told me.
Now and then, legacy titans voiced their scorn. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J. P. Morgan, labelled crypto “a fraud”; Warren Buffett used the phrase “rat poison squared.” Legions of skeptics and technophobes, out of envy, ignorance, or wisdom, savored such pronouncements, while the true believers and the vertiginously invested mostly brushed it aside. They had faith that a new order was nigh. They pumped but did not dump.
Among a certain subset, it was both fashionable and integral to ignore the fluctuations in price. The idea was to build and shore up a new system—for everything from payments and banking to health care and identity—that was either a replacement for the old one, or at least an alternative to it, one that was borderless, independent of state control and of exploitation by Big Tech. “It’s definitely nice to try to eke out some completely parallel kind of world that’s totally separate from the existing one,” Buterin said. “It does interact with the rest of society, and the goal is definitely to help improve the mainstream world, but we’re on a different track.” Such an undertaking would, at best, take many years and likely span several economic and investment cycles. While the old armature rots, a new one rises alongside it, much as the new Tappan Zee Bridge, over the Hudson, gradually took shape next to the rusty old one it would one day replace. To Buterin, however, the benefits were already clear. “The cryptocurrency space has succeeded at making certain aspects of the international economy more open, when politics is moving in the exact opposite direction,” he said. “I do think that’s a meaningful contribution to the world.”
Buterin is a striking figure, tall and very lean, with long, fidgety fingers, sharp elfin features, and vivid blue eyes, which, on the rare occasions when he allows them to meet yours, convey a depth and warmth that you don’t expect, in light of the flat, robotic cadence and tone of his speech. People often joke about him being an alien, but they usually apologize for doing so, because there’s a gentleness about him, an air of tolerance and moderation, that works as a built-in rebuke to such unkind remarks. As we spoke, on the first afternoon of the Montreal conference (the crypto life is a never-ending enchainment of conferences, and is pretty much wall-to-wall dudes), he aligned some items in front of him: pens, Post-its, phone. He forgoes most social niceties and overt expressions of emotion but, when he finds questions or assertions agreeable, is generous with notes of encouragement: “Yep, yep, yep”; “Right, totally”; “Yes, yes, exactly.” Arguable remarks elicit a mechanical “Hmm.” He seems to anticipate your question before you even know quite what it is, but he forces himself to allow you to finish. He has a dry sense of humor.
He said, “I definitely don’t have the kind of single-minded C.E.O. personality that a lot of Silicon Valley V.C.s lionize—that thing of being ambitious and wanting to win at all costs, like, basically, Mark Zuckerberg ( ).” He was dressed that day, as on the day before and the day after, in a gray turtleneck, black track pants, and laceless Adidas sneakers over turquoise socks. He often wears T-shirts with unicorns and rainbows. He likes to cite Lambos—as in Lamborghini, the cryptobro trophy ride of choice—as shorthand for the excessive trappings of wealth, which do not interest him. He’s about as indifferently rich as a man can be. Although he sold a quarter of his bitcoin and ether well before the prices began to soar last year, he is said to be worth somewhere in the vicinity of a hundred million dollars. (He recently gave away a couple of million dollars to a life-extension research project.) He has no assistants or entourage. He owns little and travels light. “Recently, I reduced my bag size from sixty litres to forty,” he said. “Forty is very tolerable. You can go on fifteen-kilometre walks with it.” The Adidas, he said, were his only pair of shoes. “Actually, I have another pair that’s in one of the many places I call home.” These are friends’ apartments, where he sometimes sleeps for a few nights at a stretch—in Toronto, San Francisco, Singapore, Shanghai, Taipei. He especially likes East Asia. He speaks fluent Mandarin.
After Montreal, he was headed to Berlin and then Switzerland. His home, really, is the Internet. At one point, I referred to an Ethereum outpost in San Francisco, which I’d read about, as a “base of operations,” and he rejected the term: “Home. Base of operations. The more you invent your own life style, the more you realize that the categories that have been invented are ultimately, at best, imperfect devices for understanding the world, and, at worst, fake.”
I’d been trying for months to talk to Buterin. In January, I reached out to his father, Dmitry, who reported back that Vitalik was not interested in an interview. “He is trying to focus his time on research,” Dmitry said. “He’s not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.” Dmitry Buterin, forty-six, is from Grozny, in Chechnya. He studied computer science in Moscow and then started a financial-software business, before emigrating to Canada, when Vitalik was six. Dmitry settled in Toronto, with Vitalik; Vitalik’s mother, a financial analyst, chose Edmonton. Vitalik, when he was three, got an old PC and began fiddling around with Excel. By ten or eleven, he was developing video games. “Vitalik was a very smart boy,” his father said. “It was not easy. His mind was always racing. It was hard for him to communicate. He hardly spoke until he was nine or ten. I was concerned, but at some point I realized it is what it is. I just gave him my love.”
He also gave Vitalik his first glimpse of Bitcoin. It was 2011, somewhat early, but Dmitry was an avowed anarcho-capitalist, a cynical child of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. For many others like him, especially in those early days, the first encounter with Bitcoin was like a religious epiphany—powerful, life-altering, a glimpse of an entirely different and perhaps more agreeable way of ordering human affairs. “Bitcoin looks like money’s dream of itself,” the technology journalist Brian Patrick Eha wrote, in “ How Money Got Free ( ).”
“Before Bitcoin came along, I was happily playing World of Warcraft,” Vitalik told me. He had already been nursing some inchoate ideas about the risks and intrinsic unfairness of centralized systems and authority. He once told a journalist, “I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, ‘Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time?’ ” Bitcoin scratched this itch. But in many ways what drew him in was the elegance of the system, invented, it seemed, by a rogue outsider out of thin air. It suited a world view, a dream of a fluid, borderless, decentralized financial system beyond the reach of governments and banks, inclined as they inevitably are toward corruption and self-dealing, or at least toward distortions of incentive. Buterin said, “If you look at the people that were involved in the early stages of the Bitcoin space, their earlier pedigrees, if they had any pedigrees at all, were in open source—Linux, Mozilla, and cypherpunk mailing lists.” These were subversives and libertarians, ranging in political affinity from far left to weird right, as often as not without institutional or academic stature or access. “I found it immensely empowering that just a few thousand people like myself could re-create this fundamental social institution from nothing.”
In the eighties, cryptographers and computer scientists began trying to devise a foolproof form of digital money, and a way to execute transactions and contracts without the involvement (or rent-seeking) of third parties. It was the man, woman, or group of humans known as Satoshi Nakamoto who, with Bitcoin in 2008, solved the crux—the so-called double-spend problem. If you have ten dollars, you shouldn’t be able to pay ten dollars for one thing, then spend the same ten for another. This requires some mechanism for keeping track of what you have, whom you gave it to, and how much they now have. And that was the blockchain.
Definitions of blockchain are as various as the metaphors—bingo, Google Docs, a giant room of transparent safes—that people use to try to illustrate them. Broadly speaking, a blockchain is an evolving record of all transactions that is maintained, simultaneously and in common, by every computer in the network of that blockchain, be it Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Monero. Think, as some have suggested, of a dusty leather-bound ledger in a Dickensian counting house, a record of every transaction relevant to that practice. Except that every accountant in London, and in Calcutta, has the same ledger, and when one adds a line to his own the addition appears in all of them. Once a transaction is affirmed, it will—theoretically, anyway—be in the ledger forever, unalterable and unerasable.
Historically, records have been stored in one place—a temple, a courthouse, a server—and kept by whoever presided. If you distrust central authority, or are queasy about Google, this won’t do at all. With blockchains, the records, under a kind of cryptographic seal, are distributed to all and belong to no one. You can’t revise them, because everyone is watching, and because the software will reject it if you try. There is no Undo button. Each block is essentially a bundle of transactions, with a tracking notation, represented in a bit of cryptographic code known as a “hash,” of all the transactions in the past. Each new block in the chain contains all the information (or, really, via the hash, a secure reference to all the information) contained in the previous one, all the way back to the first one, the so-called genesis block.
The odds are high that someone, somewhere, has attempted to make an explanation like this one to you. The chain-splainer is a notorious date spoiler and cocktail-party pariah. Here he comes—you’re trapped. You should have known better than to ask about mining.
Mining is a reward system—compensation for helping to maintain and build a blockchain. The work of establishing and recording what’s legit takes machinery, memory, power, and time. Cryptocurrency blockchains require that a bunch of computers run software to affirm (or reject) transactions—it’s a kind of automated convocation. During this ritual, the computers in the network are competing, via brute guesswork, to be the first to get the answer to a really difficult math problem. The more computational power you have, the more guesses you can make, and the more likely you are to get the answer. The winner creates a new block and gets a reward, in, say, bitcoin—new bitcoin, which has not previously been in circulation. (Satoshi ordained that there be a finite number of bitcoin ever created—twenty-one million—so that no one could inflate away the value of existing bitcoin, as, say, the Federal Reserve does with dollars. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether, don’t necessarily have finite supplies.)
This system is known as Proof of Work. The problem-solving exercise is proof that the computers are doing the work. This approach has serious and, some would say, fatal, flaws. First, it requires a tremendous amount of electricity. This year, it is said, the Bitcoin network will use as much energy as the nation of Austria, and produce as much carbon dioxide as a million transatlantic flights. Mining rigs—computers designed specifically to do this work—are thirsty machines. Mining farms tend to sprout up where juice is cheap (typically, in proximity to hydropower projects with excess capacity to unload) and where temperatures are low (so you don’t have to burn even more electricity to keep the rigs cool). There are open-air warehouses in remote corners of sub-Arctic Canada, Russia, and China, with machines whirring away on the tundra, creating magic money, while the permafrost melts. Second, a small number of mining conglomerates, or pools—many of them Chinese—have wielded outsized influence over the network and the decisions that get made. Last month, one of the biggest of these, Bitmain, confirmed plans to go public.
The alternative, which Zamfir and Buterin were working on in Montreal, is called Proof of Stake. In this scenario, the holders of the currency in question become the validators, who typically take a small cut of every approved transaction. Theoretically, the more crypto you have, the more influence you have, so PoW partisans consider PoS to be plutocratic as well—a new gloss on the old problem of too much in the hands of too few.
In 2013, Buterin travelled to San Jose for a Bitcoin meet-up, and felt that he’d encountered like-minded people for the first time in his life—a movement worth devoting himself to. “The people that I had been searching for the whole time were actually all there,” Buterin told me. Zooko Wilcox, a cryptographer, recalled Buterin telling him, “This is the first technology I’ve ever loved that loves me back.” Buterin had been writing blog posts about it for five bitcoins per post. Together, he and Mihai Alisie, a Romanian blockchain entrepreneur who’d read his posts, founded Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin had a knack for explaining things—at least to an audience already primed to understand. But, as he travelled around the world to Bitcoin meet-ups, he began to think that the technology was limited, that attempts to jury-rig non-money uses for this digital-money platform was the computational equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. You basically had to devise hacks. He envisaged a one-blade-fits-all version, a blockchain platform that was broader and more adaptable to a wider array of uses and applications. The concept behind Bitcoin—a network of machines all over the world—seemed to be a building block upon which to construct a global computer capable of all kinds of activities.
In the mid-nineties, Nick Szabo, a cryptographer and early cypherpunk, coined the term “smart contract,” which two decades later became the basis of Ethereum. This is a means of setting and enforcing the terms of an agreement without a middleman—no lawyer, notary, bookie, or referee. The terms are enshrined in and triggered by code, rather than by someone’s interpretation of legal language or fit of pique. The proposition is that computer code, unlike, say, Hammurabi’s or the Federal Reserve’s, is impartial—that it can eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the role of toxic subjectivity. This could cover a simple exchange of digital money, or the sale of a house, or an insurance payout, or a bet. Szabo’s preferred metaphor was the vending machine. You don’t generally require someone to vouch for the machine. In a smart-contract world, as he described it, if a borrower hasn’t paid off his car loans in time his car just stops working, as per the terms of the loan, which are embedded in the code and integrated into the mechanism of the car.
The reliability of the code, and of the system for checking it, would discharge humans from having to read minds and look into hearts, or from having to pay someone else to make up for the fact that they cannot. As it stands, here in the dusty old legacy economy, we have to pay other people, and squander time and resources, to establish a modicum of trust. It’s a legalized kind of protection racket. A favorite example is title insurance; an entire industry exists to prove that the person selling you a house is the owner in good standing. Provenance—of property, both real and intellectual—is big business, but, to the blockchain believers, it need not be. Code shall banish the odious frictions and costs. “Blockchains are more fundamentally about increasing our ability to collaborate across these large social distances,” Buterin said. “It’s the trust machine bringing more trust where there was less trust before.”
Another thing we presently outsource, perhaps to our peril, is our identity: the affirmation of who we are, along with whatever data sticks to that. Identity as we know it now is typically maintained by a centralized state—by the taxman, the department of motor vehicles, the police. Then it spills out into the world, often without our knowledge or consent, through our transaction histories, browsing habits, and unencrypted communications. In the Google era, we spray aspects of ourselves all over the Internet. The blockchain innovation is what’s often called “self-sovereign identity,” the idea that you’ll control and parcel out information about yourself, as you wish. The Ethereum network maintains the attestation.
Then there are those vast realms where the old intermediaries hardly exist at all. The trust machine’s most obvious beneficiaries are said to be the disenfranchised and the so-called unbanked—the billions of humans around the world with no passports or access to any reliable kind of financial system. We may find it harder to see the utility here in our daily lives, where we can rely on Citibank, Visa, Venmo, and Western Union to handle our transactions and keep track of all the money flying around. Amid such a sturdy (if extractive) system, the blockchain can seem like a back-office fix, a change in the accounting scheme, of interest to the systems geeks and bean counters but not to oblivious customers. But if you are, say, a Venezuelan citizen or a Turkish journalist, or a refugee from Syria or Myanmar, the prospect of being able to maintain and render portable both money and identity could be hugely liberating, perhaps even life-saving. Unless you forget your private key.
In November, 2013, Buterin wrote up a white paper—cryptoland is a blizzard of white papers—proposing a new open-source, distributed computing platform upon which you could build all kinds of smart-contract applications and uses, as well as other coins. He called it Ethereum. “I was browsing a list of elements from science fiction on Wikipedia when I came across the name,” he said then. “I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word ‘ether,’ referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.” He expected that experienced cryptographers would pick his proposal to pieces. Instead, everyone who read it seemed to be impressed by its elegance and ambition. Among the early enthusiasts were a handful of Toronto Bitcoiners who’d got to know one another at informal meet-ups and in a Skype group chat—“a regular call with serious people,” as one of them recalled.
The foundational gathering, in the Ethereum creation story, occurred at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January, 2014. These serious people decided to rent a beach house, and there, in a week or so, banged out a fuller sense of what Ethereum, Buterin’s “computer in the sky,” as he described it to me, might become. They defined themselves as founders. Among them were Gavin Wood (a British programmer who later took on the role of Ethereum’s chief technology officer), Charles Hoskinson (a Colorado programmer who was briefly the C.E.O.), and Anthony Di Iorio, a Torontonian who was underwriting the project. Di Iorio had invited a fellow Toronto Bitcoiner named Joseph Lubin, then forty-nine, who, with a sense of the import of the occasion, brought along the reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness. She later described it as “an after-hours grease trap” for dozens of additional participants in the conference. (The online publication Backchannel published her story ( ) , as well as a photograph she’d snapped of Buterin working at his laptop one morning while the rest of the house slept. Peck says that the pot pipe on the table next to him wasn’t his.)
Buterin’s Miami début of Ethereum was a hit. Nineteen at the time, he dropped out of the University of Waterloo, where he’d been studying computer science, and devoted himself full time to the Ethereum project. “We realized this was going to be big,” Hoskinson recalled.
The founders assumed different roles. Lubin, who had Wall Street experience, was the chief operating officer. “That’s one of the silly titles we chose to give ourselves,” Lubin told me. “It didn’t really mean anything in that weird open-source project.” (Buterin dubbed himself the C-3PO.) Lubin positioned himself as the grownup in the room, the worldly chaperon. Wood, with whom he eventually clashed, said, “He wanted to be the mentor, the Obi-Wan Kenobi, but unfortunately he became the Darth Vader.”
Months of work ensued, in which the founders came up with a lexicon and a conceptual framework both to define Ethereum in lay(ish) terms and to inoculate it against possible legal consequences. When the idea arose to sell new cryptocoins to the public, to raise money for the project, Lubin, along with Hoskinson, recognized that this might be a fraught enterprise. “Some people, including me, pointed out that it looks like we were going to raise tens of millions of dollars from bitcoin nouveau riche and that we might want to talk to some lawyers—that we should be concerned that we might be selling an unregistered security to Americans,” Lubin said. It was an exercise in semiotics with vital legal implications.
“In that process, we pretty much defined what Ethereum is and what ether is,” Lubin said. “We realized—I realized—that we had an opportunity to tell people what this is, and there was a good chance that they were just going to accept our understanding and that we could create reality that way. And it seems to have worked. We seem to have created a reality.” Language is consciousness: they defined ether as a “crypto-fuel,” which one needs to run programs and store data on the Ethereum system. Wood, at a meet-up in New York, called it “a computer at the center of the world,” like a sixties-era mainframe that everyone everywhere can use.
The founders took to calling it “the world computer,” and debated the best corporate conveyance. Should it be a for-profit entity funded by an I.C.O. or by venture capital—like Ripple, an earlier cryptocurrency protocol launch—or a not-for-profit foundation, with independent oversight? Different groups among the eight founders staked out different positions, with some favoring for-profit, others not-for-profit. “Things started souring pretty quickly,” Hoskinson recalls. Wood told me, “There was this sense, which I found distasteful, that Vitalik was the goose that laid the golden egg, and he was treated in that objectivizing form by everyone else, like he was some alien from Mars sent to help us all.”
“There was a lot of drama,” Lubin said. “It got really complicated.” Broadly speaking, the developers, among them Wood, were wary of the motives and methods of the business guys, who in turn felt that the developers lacked practical sense and an appreciation for the allure of a big payday.
Eventually, the founders agreed to let Buterin decide. “I was definitely the person that people had respected and trusted more than they trusted each other, which was unfortunate and sad,” Buterin said. He was also, he said, “seemingly the most harmless of the group.”
Six months after Miami, the whole team holed up in a house in Switzerland, in the canton of Zug, an old commodities-hedge-fund tax haven now known as Crypto Valley. This was the first time all of the founders were in one room together. Buterin, after some time alone on the patio, told Hoskinson and another founder that they were out. Later, he made clear that Ethereum would proceed as a nonprofit. “It was a shitty time, and it was a shitty thing for Vitalik to have to do,” Wood said.
“That was one of those few nuclear bombs that I threw into the Ethereum governance process,” Buterin told me. “I felt very strongly that Ethereum is meant to be this open-source project for the world,” he continued. “Having a for-profit entity be at the center of it felt like going way too far in this centralized direction.” The remaining founders established the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, with headquarters in Zug, to help fund development. (Ethereum itself is based nowhere, and in traditional corporate terms is as substantial as the ether.)
And so the founders, driven by discord and the appeal of more lucrative endeavors, decentralized themselves. “We all scattered to the winds,” Hoskinson told me. He eventually started a crypto company called IOHK, and a blockchain project called Cardano. “Now I run my own company, with a hundred and sixty people,” he told me. “I’m basically a billionaire. At this point, I couldn’t care less about those six months of my life with Ethereum.”
What would a world reconstituted by smart contracts look like? One grasps at legacy tableaux: office towers emptied of bankers, lawyers, and accountants; crypto-utopian settlements on hurricane-ravaged Caribbean islands; open-air barns out on the steppes, stacked with bitcoin-mining computers. In May, I attended the Ethereal Summit, a conference held in a former industrial glassworks in Maspeth, Queens. The symbolism—new order sprouting up in the derelict precincts of the old—was on the nose, as was the vibe: food trucks, local craft beers, a “Zen Zone” meditation tent. Here was blockchain as life style. Two big bathrooms, side by side, started out unisex, but by the afternoon of the first day the conference attendees, at the urging of no centralized authority, were self-sorting: men to the one on the right, women the one on the left.
On the main stage, a roster of luminaries and evangelists served up a steady diet of jargon stew, but elsewhere in the old factory you could find spoonfuls of sugar—use cases for English majors. One was a presentation of a supply-chain startup called Viant, which had deployed the blockchain to track fish from “bait to plate.” A video depicted a yellowfin tuna caught off Fiji on April 10th. And here it was, a month later, as sashimi, its provenance indisputable, trusted, immutable, thanks to the blockchain. Everyone surged forward for a free taste—plate-to-mouth still requiring humans to jostle and reach. There was a panel discussion with the founders of Civil, an attempt to use the blockchain to remake the journalism business, amid the wreckage wrought by the Internet and the demise of the advertising model. And, in a small brick outbuilding, there was a demonstration of something called Cellarius, which was, according to its founder, Igor Lilic, (1) a crowdsourced sci-fi story, set in the year 2084, after the activation of an artificial super-intelligence; (2) a community of artists and collaborators; and (3) a technological platform that its developers were gradually building out. “It’s a hypothesis,” Lilic said. “The long-term goal is to figure out some new economics of intellectual property.” A worthy goal, Lord knows, and yet I failed to understand what it had to do with distributed ledgers or consensus algorithms.
The host of the conference was ConsenSys, a company that Lubin started, in Brooklyn, in 2014, after he left Ethereum. ConsenSys is an incubator of new businesses and projects that operate—or will, or would—on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the Ethereum community’s most prominent and ubiquitous developer and promoter of what are called DApps, for decentralized applications, less for stuff like tuna fish or sci-fi than for such fundamentals of commerce as property ownership, identity management, document verification, commodities trading, and legal agreements—the rudiments of what Lubin calls the infrastructure of a new decentralized economy.
ConsenSys’s home base, in a graffittied industrial space in Bushwick, is a defiant, almost ostentatious expression of an anti-corporate ethos—a nod to crypto’s anarchic underpinnings, but with a bit of pretense, since ConsenSys consults with businesses and governments seeking help in building private blockchains. A friend who has done some work with them said, “They have billions of dollars to spend. Why is it like this? Why don’t they have an office on Twenty-eighth Street in Manhattan, like everyone else?” The firm now has more than a thousand employees, in offices around the world. (Lubin says that they’ve hired a lot of people from I.B.M.) “They have so much money,” another member of the community said. “The approach is, throw it all at the wall and see what sticks.” So far, not much has. They can cite dozens of projects in various stages of emergence; none has morphed into a killer DApp.
Lubin is said to be the largest holder of ether and is estimated to be worth more than a billion dollars. A few people told me that he had started ConsenSys to enhance the value of his ether. When I asked him about this, he scoffed. “What a poor strategy that would be for making money,” he said. “Like, yeah, I’m going to build a company on an ecosystem that doesn’t exist, so I can increase the value of my Internet magic-money holdings.” He went on, “The people who were in the space early were there for philosophical reasons, for political or economic reasons not tied to their personal wealth.” ConsenSys has instituted a policy that forbids employees from talking about price. I went to see Lubin in Bushwick one day, after ether, and other currencies, had suffered a huge drop in value overnight. When I asked him about the plunge, he said, “Who gives a fuck?” Not a cryptobillionaire, apparently.
For a great number of people at Ethereal, there was an evangelical fervor—techno-utopianism in a new guise, unaffiliated, for the most part, with Silicon Valley and the cults of Elon and @Jack. The director of the Ethereum Foundation, Aya Miyaguchi, told me, “We want to change the world. We actually believe in it.”
The first time I met Lubin, who was with his chief marketing officer, Amanda Gutterman—over tacos in Williamsburg, in the summer of 2017—Gutterman said, “We call him white Morpheus,” in reference to the Laurence Fishburne character in “The Matrix.” (It started as a meme on Reddit.) Lubin summoned a parallel reality, where heretofore unempowered citizens would be able to perform amazing feats. Like Buterin, he rejects the primacy, in business, of the charismatic founder, and yet the world can seem to insist on it. If Buterin, who is often depicted in fan art as Jesus with a Lambo, is a kind of blockchain messiah, Lubin is its Paul, both in his tireless evangelism and in his attention to practical, worldly matters. He is an Ethereum true believer, but he is also a proponent of so-called enterprise applications—actual business uses, often on private blockchains—which could get the legacy world interested in hastening its own obsolescence.
“Joe gets criticized for trying to push Ethereum into enterprise,” Emin Gün Sirer, a professor of computer science at Cornell who has worked with Ethereum, says. “You have two sides to it all. The one that appeals to the fringe counterculture versus the one where someone has to pay all these developers’ bills. One to appeal to the cypherpunk kids, another to appeal to the adults in the room.”
Lubin has a shaved head and the flat accent of a native Torontonian. In a roast-tinged panel discussion at Ethereal, the comedian Ronny Chieng, from “The Daily Show,” worked Lubin over for his fashion sense (stone-washed jeans and big swag-bag T-shirts), for the fact that his features don’t seem to move when he talks (“You’d get more investors if you moved your face”), and for his apparent inability to explain anything without using words that were invented less than two years ago.
Reared in Toronto (his father is a dentist, his mother a retired real-estate broker), Lubin played squash and studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton. Among his roommates were Mike Novogratz, now a hedge-fund investor, who in 2017 became the Wall Street face of the crypto boom ( ) , and a wrestler named Richard Tavoso, known as Fudge, who kept a record of who owed what to whom in their regular poker games. Fudge’s ledger became a handy analogy for other roommates and friends, thirty years later, when they followed Lubin and Novogratz into the blockchain boom.
After graduating, Lubin tried to make a go of it as a pro squash player while working as a researcher on artificial-intelligence experiments, helping to build nervous systems and visual systems for robots. He married young, had a son, got divorced. There followed some years of programming and Wall Street work, including at Goldman Sachs and then at a banking consortium called Identrus. “That’s where I learned about cryptography, and how to write software with cryptographic systems,” he said. He later developed a program for trading currencies and securities, started a fund, and did very well. Nonetheless, his encounters with the global financial markets, before and after the 2008 collapse, and his earlier immersion in science fiction and cyberpunk culture, put him in a quasi-apocalyptic frame of mind. (He has entertained the theory that was an inside job.) He looked into buying land in Peru or Ecuador—“This was out of fear, a scarcity mind-set, the expectation of a cascading collapse of financial systems,” he said—but instead began planning a vertical farm in Brooklyn. Before he could see that idea through, he became friends with a Jamaican model and actress and moved to Kingston to help her launch a musical career. They got a house, built a recording studio, recorded some songs, and made some videos. “Then things kind of fell apart,” he said. “It just got very complicated. And then Ethereum happened.”
He’d got into Bitcoin in 2011, when he came across the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper on Slashdot and began studying Bitcoin and new protocols in the works. But it was Buterin’s white paper that changed his life. “Vitalik’s paper was the best that I had read,” Lubin said. He met Buterin at a meet-up in Toronto on New Year’s Day, 2014. (I asked Lubin what that was like. “We talked about blockchain,” he said.)
Lubin gets a twinkle in his eye when he talks about what he sees as the first opportunity in human history to create systems without the traditional clerical class, the old priesthood of the record keepers, rune readers, and bean counters. Still, he acknowledges, “You’ll certainly need priests to build these systems.” These would be the top-end coders, the devs. William Shatner has called crypto “cyber-snob currency.” In some respects, we’d be replacing one priesthood with another.
“Governance” is a dismal word, but in the crypto realm it has profound implications. It concerns how decisions are made, and who gets to make them. Each blockchain—as a technology, a community, and a social experiment—is an exercise in achieving consensus. The quest is a human one, so the mechanisms that rule it reflect the priorities of the mechanics. Technology, as we learn time and again, is no cure for human nature. Power accrues, even when the goal is to eliminate it. Szabo, the father of smart contracts and a staunch libertarian, tweeted recently, “Blockchain governance generally comes in only three varieties: (1) Lord of the Flies, (2) lawyers, or (3) ruthlessly minimized.” Someone asked, “Why ruthless?” and Szabo wrote, “Otherwise the children or the lawyers will win.”
Sometimes it can seem less “Lord of the Flies” than “Life of Brian”—a comical exercise in the narcissism of small differences. The Judean People’s Front versus the People’s Front of Judea. Last year, when bitcoin miners and developers clashed over how to increase the efficiency of the network, a faction split off—a maneuver called a hard fork—and created a new version of bitcoin, called Bitcoin Cash, whose most visible cheerleader is Roger Ver, a libertarian sometimes called Bitcoin Jesus. (He likes to say that digital money is as important an invention as the wheel, electricity, and the transistor.) Ver, who lives in Japan, was sentenced to ten months in prison for selling explosives online; this seems to have both inflamed his mistrust of institutional authority and enhanced his credibility as an anarcho-capitalist. Ver regularly declares that Bitcoin Cash is the true bitcoin, in keeping with the ideas set forth by Satoshi (as opposed to those espoused by all the “Faketoshis”).
The guiding principle in cryptoworld’s regular schisms is a version of “Love it or leave it.” The viability of any particular upgrade or project is measured by the extent to which people decide to adopt or participate in it. They do so either on the merits—a common invocation is D.Y.O.W. (do your own work)—or on the basis of the reputations of those proposing, endorsing, or criticizing any particular idea.
In the absence of formal hierarchy, reputational capital is paramount. The campaign to acquire it is waged largely on social media and on conference-panel stages. As the crypto stars strut their stuff, declare their allegiances, and taunt their rivals, you wind up with shifting, indistinct pecking orders. “Our governance is inherently social,” Vlad Zamfir said, on one such stage. “People who are more connected in the community have more power, a kind of soft power.”
“There’s definitely, in all blockchains and cryptocurrencies, some notion of what I call the high priest,” Buterin told me. “A high priest is basically someone who has high status inside a cryptocurrency community for whatever reason, and sometimes high priests say things. I don’t know if you want to mix religious metaphors, but they can issue fatwas.” Buterin wasn’t excluding himself. He has no real institutional writ or hierarchal role and yet is, by default and by consensus, Ethereum’s face and figurehead, as much the arbiter as on the day he paced the patio in Zug. It’s a position that he’s not entirely eager to maintain. “The Ethereum community can’t survive in the long term if it’s completely dependent on me,” he said. “I think the right way to do that isn’t to subtract myself. It’s to add other people that can complement and potentially replace myself. There have been more and more outspoken core developers. I’ve acted in deliberate ways, for example, to encourage more high priests in the Ethereum community to show up. One of the things you can do is tolerate them.”
“Perceived authority and real authority blur,” Hoskinson told me. “Vitalik hasn’t been elected to anything or endowed with any actual power. But when he speaks millions of people around the world listen.”
Or they attack him. “Vitalik has shouldered the weight of the world—of the unbelievable number of total assholes picking at him from a distance on the Internet, and he’s done it at the age of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, with a lot of grace,” Lubin said. Last year, someone posted on a chat forum that Buterin had died in a car crash. The price of ether plummeted. To counter the report, Buterin posted a photo of himself, with a blockchain-appropriate time stamp—an Ethereum block number and its corresponding hash, written on a piece of paper. The price stabilized.
The most infamous crisis in the governance of Ethereum was the demise of the DAO —short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The DAO was a crowdsourced venture fund, a way of using smart contracts to cut out traditional venture capitalists, reduce fees, and give access to regular civilians, who contributed ether and voted on which projects to invest in. Two early aspirants were a German smart-locks startup (for rental properties and bicycles) and a French autonomous-electric-minicar ride-sharing venture. At the time, it was the biggest crowdfunding ever—the equivalent, then, of about a quarter-billion dollars, and, now, of about two billion. Within weeks, it was hacked. There was a loophole in the code; the hacker, who could repeatedly take money out of the DAO before the transfers were recorded, drained more than a quarter of the funds.
“Vitalik was powerless,” Emin Gün Sirer, the Cornell professor, who, with Zamfir, had been involved in critiquing the DAO , told me. Along with others, Sirer said, Buterin “had to spam Ethereum with other transactions to slow down the hacker.”
Some in the Ethereum community, including Buterin, Sirer, and Zamfir, argued for what was, effectively, the reversing of the transactions—altering what was supposed to have been unalterable—in order to restore the funds to the people who’d invested in the DAO. Others insisted that doing so would be a violation of the principle that blocks must remain immutable. “We were all wondering, Is code law?” Sirer recalled. “What is code? What is law? What is the covenant? It was almost epistemological. We were a bunch of computer geeks way out of our depth.” A schism ensued—a hard fork. The majority of Ethereum users followed Buterin and other prominent figures onto a new blockchain, while the fundamentalists stayed on the old chain, according to which the ether had been lost. The latter became known as Ethereum Classic, where, theoretically, the hacker, whoever it is, still holds stolen ether.
To make a perilous generalization, the Bitcoin community seems to be more contentious and confrontational than Ethereum’s, especially when it comes to internecine battles. The bitcoin-or-bust crowd, including the so-called HODL ers, play a bruising game on Reddit and Twitter. ( HODL , derived from a drunken typo of “hold” five years ago on a Bitcoin message board, is shorthand for holding onto one’s bitcoin, come hell or high water, and is a Bitcoin maximalist battle cry.) In some respects, Bitcoin is as much a critique of the fiat money system as it is an alternative to it. As such, there’s a side to it that seems always to be scrapping for a fight. It wants you to hold its beer. Ethereum retains some of Bitcoin’s scrappy, libertarian characteristics, but, as a foundation for many other uses, it is by nature more fungible. The Ethereum network is a platform for other currencies and tokens. It’s a bigger tent.
At any rate, Sirer said, “the hard fork was the best thing that happened to Ethereum. It showed that Ethereum took errors seriously. And that it was practical and not dogmatic. It chose the right thing over the letter of the law—or, really, the letter of the code.”
A small sliver of the population understands blockchain technology well enough to engage in fierce, esoteric debate over the meaning and relative importance of various ideas and terms. At the highest levels, everyone practices a kind of obscurantism, unwitting or otherwise. Elsewhere, people fake it. An investor who has met with Joe Lubin and Mike Novogratz, and who is getting up to speed for the purpose of a token sale for a publicly traded company, told me one day, with regard to levels of understanding, “Joe, I’m guessing, is an 8.5 or maybe even a 9, out of 10. Vitalik, whom I’ve never met, I’m guessing is a 9.2. I’m probably a 2.5, maybe a 3. My tech guy is probably a 7, and I’ve met a few 4s and 5s who work in the space. But most every trader coming in from other fields that I’ve met is 2.5 or lower.”
Peter Smith, the C.E.O. and co-founder of a cryptocurrency platform called Blockchain, told me one afternoon, “This is my life’s work, inventing a category, and I give myself a 4 out of 5. I don’t know anyone who’s a 5.”
A friend of mine who is involved in a blockchain startup remarked that people keep trying to explain the underlying technology—the engine under the hood rather than the car on the road. “It’s like they’re trying to describe e-mail to people, and instead of saying, ‘You can send messages to people over the Internet,’ they’re saying, ‘There’s a protocol called S.M.T.P., which locates a set of rules for the movement of files from one to another.’ ” And yet he also complained about what he calls the incorrigibles, the Luddites who refuse even to try, whom he likened to the people in an office who profess not to know how to work the copy machine.
Public understanding of the space has also been hindered by an abundance of silliness ( ). The more frivolous uses and manifestations are the jazz hands of crypto, distracting from subtler virtues or cynical schemes. It was somehow unsurprising when the founders of a crypto debit card called Centra, which had been endorsed, to widespread sniggering, by the boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., and the producer DJ Khaled, were arrested for securities and wire fraud. (They pleaded not guilty.) The gold rush attracts a cartoonish array: Ashton Kutcher, 50 Cent, Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton, Brock Pierce (former child star of “The Mighty Ducks”), and, of course, the Winklevoss twins, who plowed their Facebook settlement money into bitcoin and were later widely cited as crypto’s first billionaires.
It is now a well-worn joke that one need only throw the word “blockchain” around to raise money or to seem smart. When the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp., its share price nearly tripled, even though it hadn’t really attempted to articulate any case for how a distributed ledger might be a panacea for the hawking of sugary drinks. Every few weeks, it seems, there’s a new entry in the did-you-hear category of goofy alt-I.C.O.s. One day it’s Bananacoin, offered by banana plantations in Laos and pegged to the price of a kilo of Lady Fingers, and another it’s Dentacoin, a dentistry token, which—but, seriously—at one point had a market cap of more than two billion dollars. Coinye (the Shitcoin Formerly Known as Coinye West) might have had a shot, too, had its developers not been sued by Kanye for trademark infringement. Jesus Coin (a parody coin that has nonetheless been traded like a real one) and Christ Coin (a non-parody coin that has been shunned as though it were a spoof) have encountered no namesake legal issues. Nor has Mike Tyson Bitcoin, a digital-wallet app, about which Tyson said, “In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting, and I’m intrigued with the possibilities.” Turns out there is even a Koi Coin, worth a fraction of a penny.
Last December, as the price of ether was shooting up, the most popular DApp on Ethereum was CryptoKitties, a virtual-pet-collection racket—you adopt as a pet (or pets) unique bits of code that are stored on the network. Founder Cat #18—whose bio reads, in part, “When no one’s home, I invite my pals over and we listen to Rihanna. I look forward to riding unicorns with you”—changed hands last year for the ether equivalent of a hundred and ten thousand dollars. The popularity of CryptoKitties clogged the network and exposed how ill-equipped Ethereum, as currently configured, is to handle the kind of volume it would have to in order to be anything close to as transformational as its adherents claim it will be.
Over the course of a few days—Blockchain Week in New York, in May—I saw Lubin onstage at three conferences taking on doubters of different kinds. The first was Nouriel Roubini, a.k.a. Dr. Doom, the economist best known for calling the 2008 financial meltdown. The organizers of the conference, called Fluidity, had promoted this debate as a kind of prizefight. A standing-room-only crowd of true believers and opportunists crammed into the vast domed hall of a former Gilded Age savings bank in Williamsburg. Roubini quickly warmed to the role of skeptical grouch. “Ninety-nine per cent of all crypto transactions are occurring in centralized exchanges,” he said. “Vitalik Buterin is called, what, a benevolent dictator for life.” He went on, “Talking about decentralization is just nonsense.” There was some laughter, and some booing. Lubin maintained a forbearing, almost mischievous smile, and in his customary flat tone disputed the assertions one at a time. “Vitalik doesn’t really write the code,” he said. There are ten different teams that all “fight with one another.”
Roubini kept going: “Of all the recent I.C.O.s, eighty-one per cent of them are scams.” He summarized the usual blockchain pitch as being a variation on the old solution-in-search-of-a-problem spiel, and said, “It’s totally lunatic!”
Lubin seemed to be enjoying himself. His remarks, and his posture, indicated confidence that history would prove Roubini woefully incorrect. (Gavin Wood told me that, whatever his differences with Lubin, he has no doubt that he is a true believer: “It’s like Joe took some acid or some DMT and saw the light.”)
Lubin maintained the sly smile and said, “I think I may be wrong when I anticipate that it will all take more time.” Then he added, “It’s difficult being a human being living in exponential times.”
It was difficult, certainly, being a non-exponential human being during Blockchain Week. There were the conferences themselves, each a welter of feverish networking and buoyant gobbledygook, and then all the side action—a party on a boat on the East River, another above a furniture store in Bushwick. Consensus 2018, the main event, staged by the news site CoinDesk, was at the Hilton, in midtown. No Zen Zone here. The organizers had apparently sold their media list. P.R. inquiries poured into my in-box, a deluge of cryptobabble.
In a vast ballroom at the Hilton, I saw Lubin bear up under another skeptical barrage. He shared the stage with Amber Baldet, who had recently left J. P. Morgan, where she led blockchain initiatives, to launch a decentralized-application startup called Clovyr, which, with her business partner, Patrick Nielsen, she’d just announced. Like Lubin, Baldet is a proponent of finding ways to apply blockchain technology to existing businesses and corporations. They were joined by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer and true believer, who was wearing a pink shirt and a cowboy hat and leaning back in his chair with performative insouciance. Song was asked what he thought of Baldet’s Clovyr presentation.
He went on, “How can you decentralize, when you’re a corporation, which is centralizing?” He kept hammering away. “Blockchains are expensive and slow”; “You’re utilizing tools that don’t fit the problem. You end up with crap”; “You’re a hammer-thrower looking for nails”; “Blockchain is not a panacea. It’s not this magical thing that you sprinkle blockchain dust over it and it’s O.K.”
Baldet, who has tattoos and lavender hair, has become adept at finessing the cognitive dissonance between crypto-anarchism and global banking, as well as that of being a woman in a mostly male line of work. She chalked up Song’s aggressive stance to the ongoing game of reputation enhancement. You make a name in the space by staking out turf and fighting for it, onstage and online. She was also accustomed to men, especially on social media, dismissing her work out of hand.
The larger world has tended to see crypto as an asset class and, therefore, in terms defined by arrows pointing up or down, as numbers displayed either in red or in green. The fact that prices have sunk so far, from the great hype cycle of 2017, leads some to conclude that its relevance is past, its demise nigh. As a method of payment, it remains flawed, owing to sparse adoption and price volatility—it’s hard to open your crypto wallet when what you spend today on a six-pack might be enough next year to buy the brewery. Conversely, as a store of value, it has proved more fickle than the price of gold or real estate in Peru. As for its utility as a vehicle for systemic and societal renewal, it depends on whether society takes it up.
“It took crypto seven years to get to one per cent of the global financial-services market,” Peter Smith, the Blockchain C.E.O., said. “Maybe at the end of my career we’ll be at six per cent.”
David Chaum, a computer scientist in California who decades ago laid a lot of the groundwork for cryptocurrency but then failed to participate in (or capitalize on) its recent rise, told me, “There’s never been, in the history of civilization, this much money aggregated as a result of doing nothing.”
One night this month, Lubin, just back from travels to Paris, Hamburg, Singapore, Dublin, and Bermuda, was sitting up in bed in his Williamsburg apartment. “There have been and will be booms and corrections,” he said. “I’ve seen five or six already. Our ecosystem is fifty times larger than it was a year ago. The price surge attracted attention, investment, and talent. The people who signed on, they’re hooked: they can’t unsee what they’ve seen.”
At one point, at the Ethereal conference, I wandered away from a panel and made my way through the derelict factory complex, past promotional booths and Davos-calibre networking, to an airy brick hall, where Deepak Chopra was addressing a standing-room-only (and sitting-with-proper-posture-on-the-floor) audience. “We are all conditioned by the mind, by culture, by religion, by history, by economics,” he was saying. “This shoe is a human construct, this hand is a human construct, meaning is a human construct. We created money. We created blockchain. These are human constructs.”
This seemed inarguable, but perhaps beyond the purview of a crypto conference. Word around the site was that Buterin had boycotted Ethereal because of Chopra—that this was one cultic indulgence too many for the community’s mathematicians and computer scientists. (“It wasn’t a kind of decision to deliberately boycott it,” Buterin said later. “I already had plans to be in San Francisco for one quiet week, and sometimes I have to reject stuff. Obviously, I think Deepak Chopra’s crazy.”)
At a picnic table by a taco truck, I met a couple of crypto traders from Singapore. They weren’t much interested in changing the world—or in trackable tuna or in an audience with Deepak Chopra. They were in the game to make money. They told wallet-scam tales and talked about Ethereum purely in currency-trading terms. “Conferences are different here,” one said. “In Asia, they’re for business. Here they’re for marketing.”
As of last week, Lubin and Song hadn’t set the terms of their bet. For the most part, the big talk was the point. Whoever won, a few years hence, would receive the additional prize of the other being soon forgotten. ♦

Georgetown’s largest student-run international affairs conference will this year host policy-makers and experts to discuss the important topic of the future national security challenges faced by the United States. In the wake of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, how are the United States military and government adapting to meet the challenges of the 21st century? How will the United States respond to the changing landscapes of the Middle East, Asia, and Eastern Europe? These and more questions will be addressed by our keynote speaker, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, following the panel discussions. Panel topics include the changes in International Law and the ICC, the rise of defense technologies such as missile systems in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, an assessment of US-China cooperation in Southeast Asia, the role of innovative and new crypto currencies and how they will impact the global financial world, and the evolution of international surveillance. The conference will include refreshments and participants will have a chance to meet and chat with experts.
The creation of Bitcoin in 2009 stemmed the prominence of cryptocurrency and with the rise of its importance came the inevitable questions and criticisms about cryptocurrency. While cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security. Since the inception of Bitcoin, several countries have accepted the new digital currency while many others have banned or passed strict regulations on it. In addition, the immediate success of Bitcoin has also led to the establishment of other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, and Dogecoin to name a few. The rise of cryptocurrencies also brings into question the legitimacy and security of these new mediums of currency and many fear the rapid fluctuations that occur with the price of these cryptocurrencies.
Will these currencies ever be used as conventional currency? Are these currencies too volatile and risky to ever be respected globally? What is the future of these cryptocurrencies? How will these new currencies coexist with and impact the security of the current global financial system?----

Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman talks to Business Insider senior political editor Josh Barro about bitcoin. Krugman says the price of bitcoin is helped by the fact that no one understands it and people are caught up in the mystique of this new technology. Following is a transcript of the video.
*Krugman:* For the price of it. It's got this mystique about it, because it's some fancy technological thing that nobody really understands. There's been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions. There's no anchor for its value. You know, unlike pieces of paper with dead presidents on them, those are anchored by the fact that you can use them to pay taxes. There's not anchor for bitcoin. But bitcoin has developed this mystique. The price is going up, partly, it's tied up with Libertarian stuff ... I'm told that there are apocalyptic, the-end-is-coming guys who are accumulating bitcoin because once we turn into a Mad Max wasteland, having a digitally distributed – nevermind. So … I think it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And the psychology of it is clearly — if you're using the shoeshine boy test, my barber asked me about bitcoin. The feeling that people are caught up in something that they really don't understand, is overwhelming.
*Krugman:* Well, the thing about bitcoin is there isn't actually a whole lot of stuff… there's not — in a way the fact that it's completely untethered to anything real means that it doesn't fall until it … it can just hang there in mid-air for a long, long time. There's no obvious real — it's not like, you know, the housing crisis. If housing prices are unrealistic, then more housing gets built and you can see it. Bitcoin — the cost of producing of new bitcoins has gone crazily high. So that's not going to happen. So we're waiting for a Wylie Coyote moment. You know, the cartoon physics, he runs off the edge of a cliff and it's only when he looks down and realizes there's nothing under him and he goes ... So we're waiting for that sort of thing to happen. And that can go on for a long time. You know, a bubble is a natural Ponzi scheme, that's how Bob Shiller puts it. That it's — as long as it's going on everybody who bought in keeps making money and it looks good, and the fact that in the end somebody's going to be left holding the bag. Everybody assumes it's not going to be them.----




https://social.techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/

Venmo is adding support for cryptocurrency, starting today. The company says it will begin to roll out the ability for Venmo’s more than 70 million users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies directly in the app, similar to the support Venmo parent company PayPal added late last year ( ). Initially, Venmo will support four types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash — the same that PayPal offers its U.S. users.
The company had already announced ( ) its plans to introduce cryptocurrency on Venmo in 2021. Both Venmo and PayPal support for crypto come by way of a partnership with Paxos Trust Company ( ) , a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services.
Though there isn’t much differentiation between what both PayPal and Venmo offers users today, the company explains that the move is more about getting cryptocurrencies in front of a separate, and arguably younger, audience.
“While there is some overlap between the bases, there are also a lot of customers who are discretely either PayPal or Venmo users,” explains Darrell Esch, Venmo general manager and SVP. “So this ultimately gives us a new group of customers who aren’t using PayPal day in and day out the ability to access [crypto] through Venmo.”
He says that Venmo skews younger, with more of its users in their 20s and 30s, compared with the overall U.S. population. They also have other traits that might make them receptive to investing in cryptocurrencies. For example, they’re more likely than the overall U.S. population to have a college degree, they’re solidly middle-income earners and they skew toward digital natives.
The user base has also already begun purchasing crypto, Venmo notes. More than 30% had purchased crypto or equities, according to a 2020 Venmo customer study. This picked up during the pandemic, as well.
At launch, Venmo will leverage its in-app social feed to spread the word about cryptocurrencies. Users can share their crypto transactions to the feed, if they choose. This will raise awareness and engagement with the idea of crypto, as will Venmo’s new educational features. The company says it plans to publish access guides and videos inside the app that will help to answer some of the common questions about cryptocurrencies for those who are just getting started. (See below video, for example.)
Meanwhile, although PayPal announced its U.S. customers could shop with cryptocurrencies ( ) via its supported merchant base, Venmo doesn’t immediately have a similar option. However, the company as of February rolled out to its user base a feature called Business Profiles ( ) , which enables Venmo users to transact with small sellers and merchants on its app. It’s not difficult to imagine the role that crypto could play here, as well, in the future. Venmo also offers other products, including a debit and credit card, which could also be leveraged in the future to take advantage of a crypto integration, perhaps.
But in the meantime, the only way to use crypto on Venmo is by buying, selling and holding. The company says users can start with as little as a dollar and pay via their linked bank account or debit card. Of note, the Venmo wallet doesn’t connect with that of parent company PayPal, though we understand the exchange rates ( ) will be the same.----




https://www.laptopmag.com/uk/best-picks/most-energy-efficient-cryptocurrencies-the-best-picks-for-teslas-new-coin

Energy-efficient cryptocurrencies are all the rage after Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a May 12th tweet ( ) that rattled the virtual currency market. Musk announced that Tesla customers can no longer use Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin, Musk explained, is far too unkind to Mother Nature and he's on the hunt for a greener coin.
Investors are scrambling to predict which green cryptocurrency could potentially replace Bitcoin. Could it be Dogecoin ( ) (DOGE)? Well, it's a possibility. It's less eco-destructive than Bitcoin; DOGE consumes 0.12 kilowatts per hour vs. BTC's whopping 707 KWh. However, one cryptocurrency is far more environmentally friendly than DOGE.
TRG Datacenters ( ) published a study on the most energy-efficient crypto out of a sample of popular altcoins. That being said, according to TRG Datacenters' analysis, here are Tesla's potential top green picks to replace Bitcoin.
The most energy-efficient cryptocurrency is Ripple (XRP); it consumes only 0.0079 KWh per transaction. To fully grasp why Ripple is the most eco-friendly altcoin, you need to understand how it compares to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. PoW involves a network of miners competing to solve cryptographic puzzles and verify transactions using hefty computational power. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns BTC as a reward. As you can imagine, thousands of miners bumping heads to outpower one another is bound to be an eco-unfriendly system.
Although XRP is the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency, it's unlikely to be chosen as Tesla's new currency darling. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapped Ripple with a lawsuit last year ( ) , and Tesla may want to steer clear of litigation-bound coins.
Ripple is the greenest cryptocurrency of all the altcoins analyzed by TRG Datacenters. ( ) It only consumes 0.0079 kilowatts per hour (KWh) while Bitcoin's power consumption equals the energy waste of Argentina. As mentioned, Ripple doesn't use PoW like Bitcoin. It uses a protocol that polls its network to validate account balances and transactions. If the majority agrees on the transaction's integrity, it gets the green light.
Ripple facilitates cross-border financial payments. In other words, Ripple mitigates the frustration that comes with sending money to foreign nations. Currently, cross-border financial payments are slow, expensive and require several middlemen who all want a piece of the pie. Ripple, on the other hand, is super fast; it processes over 1,500 transactions per second. This is nearly seven times faster than international e-wallets like PayPal.
No, Dogecoin is not the most eco-friendly cryptocurrency, but it's not the worst either. Despite operating on a PoW protocol like Bitcoin, its underlying network only consumes 0.12 kWh. On top of that, Musk hinted that DOGE is his number one pick as Tesla's new accepted cryptocurrency.
Thanks to Musk's backing, DOGE — a joke token created by two software developers in less than two hours — is getting some serious stamps of approval, including an upcoming Coinbase listing ( ). The downside of DOGE, however, is that it's highly influenced by Musk's antics. One wrong word (ahem, "hustle") and DOGE could come crashing down.
One of the most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies is Cardano (ADA) with a KWh rate of just 0.5. In fact, this is the reason ADA survived the crypto tumble sparked by Musk. Four days after Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweet, ADA reached an all-time high of $2.42.
Cardano runs on a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol while, as mentioned, Bitcoin runs on proof-of-work. PoS involves the use of "validators": participants who earn interest for locking their coins into Cardano's blockchain network. PoS uses a consensus algorithm that randomly selects validators to verify transactions and earn rewards. PoS is a lot more sustainable than PoW because miners don't need to solve complex algorithms, and the required processing power is much lower.
Cardano aims to rectify the issues that plague other blockchains by offering a network that improves scalability, transaction speeds and decentralization. It's no wonder ADA is on our best cryptocurrencies ( ) list.
Similar to Ripple, Litecoin boasts that it's a commerce-centric digital asset that is zippier and cheaper than Bitcoin. "Litecoin features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency," the official website said.
According to InvestorPlace, ( ) Bitcoin takes 10 minutes to confirm a transaction, but Litecoin takes only 2.5 minutes. Transaction fees for Bitcoin are about $0.68 while Litecoin only sets you back $0.0024 per block.
Litecoin uses a proof-of-work protocol like Bitcoin, but it's Scrypt-based. For the sake of simplicity, all you need to know is that Scrypt lets miners generate hashes with commonly available hardware, making it easier to mine than BTC. Bitcoin, on the other hand, incentivizes miners to use energy-sucking, expensive, powerful hardware that's taxing on the environment.
Bitcoin Cash, launched in 2017, is a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain we know today. Spinning off from Bitcoin might have been a smart decision; Bitcoin Cash uses a fraction of the energy of its power-hungry parent with an eco-friendly rate of 18.957 KWh.
BCH is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the web. It's fully decentralized with no central banks and no meddling third parties. Compared to BTC, BCH offers cheaper processing fees and speedier transactions.
Bitcoin can only manage seven transactions per second; compare this to Visa's rate of 2,000 transactions per second. BCH is no Visa, but it beats Bitcoin by a mile and processes more than 100 transactions per second. People may automatically rule out Bitcoin Cash as an eco-destructive blockchain due to its name, but this is far from the truth.
Kimberly Gedeon, holding a Master's degree in International Journalism, launched her career as a journalist for MadameNoire's business beat in 2013. She loved translating stuffy stories about the economy, personal finance and investing into digestible, easy-to-understand, entertaining stories for young women of color. During her time on the business beat, she discovered her passion for tech as she dove into articles about tech entrepreneurship, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and the latest tablets. After eight years of freelancing, dabbling in a myriad of beats, she's finally found a home at Laptop Mag that accepts her as the crypto-addicted, virtual reality-loving, investing-focused, tech-fascinated nerd she is. Woot!----




https://theweek.com/article/index/242753/want-to-make-money-off-bitcoin-mining-hint-dont-mine

But Bitcoin mining ain't easy. While you can purchase coins outright ( hence its fluctuating value ( ) ), the actual process of mining is "supposed to be arduous," says Bloomberg ( ) , like extracting gold or diamonds from the earth. While you're not climbing down treacherous dig sites with a helmet, per se, you are dedicating a significant amount of computing power to solving what are essentially complex math problems.
Then there's the fact that your chances of finding coins solo are incredibly slim. Miners can go many fruitless months before they ever hear a coin's hypnotic clink ( ). For that very reason, most users join mining pools ( ) , which combine the processing power of multiple machines and distribute any bounty among members, depending on how much work they've contributed.
From an economic standpoint, that division of labor is partly why Bitcoin mining can get to be so expensive. According to Bloomberg ( ) , which uses data from a tracking site called Blockchain.info ( ) , 24 hours of mining from around the world consumes in the ballpark of $150,000 in electricity. That works out to 15 cents per kilowatt hour — a little higher than the U.S. average, and enough to power roughly 31,000 U.S. homes.
At least for now, though, the Bitcoin mining industry remains profitable business ( ) for the truly dedicated. (A recent 24-hour period of work yielded Bitcoin miners around the globe $681,000 profit.) But as more Bitcoins are discovered, the odds of finding new ones will exponentially diminish. That's why, even though about half of the global Bitcoin yield has already been pocketed, the last few probably won't be unlocked until 2030 ( ).
As TechCrunch cautions ( ) , "While you could simply set a machine aside and have it run the algorithms endlessly, the energy cost and equipment deprecation will eventually cost more than the actual Bitcoins are worth." That's why ( ) , "as with most gold rushes throughout history, it's those who are supplying the miners that are finding the real riches."----




https://www.ibtimes.com/unicef-blockchain-fund-first-un-organization-accept-cryptocurrency-donations-2845332

( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( Blockchain Fund: First UN Organization To Accept Cryptocurrency Donations ) ( Blockchain Fund: First UN Organization To Accept Cryptocurrency Donations ) ( ?&subject=UNICEF Blockchain Fund: First UN Organization To Accept Cryptocurrency )
In a move that would surprise even Bitcoin holders themselves, UNICEF gave the green light for accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for funding various initiatives, making them the first UN Organization to formally adopt cryptos in conducting transactions.
"If digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer. That's why the creation of our Cryptocurrency Fund is a significant and welcome step forward in humanitarian and development work."
UNICEF is no stranger to the blockchain technology as they also co-lead the UN Innovation Network with the World Food Programme (WFP). The UN Innovation Network is a community of UN innovators collaborating to promote innovation within the UN system, and part of the network's research is understanding the depths of blockchain and other emerging technologies.
"The Ethereum Foundation is excited to demonstrate the power of what Ethereum and blockchain technology can do for communities around the world. Together with UNICEF, we're taking action with the Cryptofund to improve access to basic needs, rights, and resources," said Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation.
An international agency like UNICEF welcoming Bitcoin and Ether may spark a wider adoption for cryptocurrencies. It's not entirely out of the question for other altcoins to follow suit, especially if the fund turns out to be a success.
Another instance where cryptos are accepted as donations is through Agatha Bacelar's campaign for Congress ( ).

*NEW YORK, 9 October 2019 –* UNICEF will now be able to receive, hold and disburse donations of cryptocurrencies ether and bitcoin, through its newly-established UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund. In a first for United Nations organizations, UNICEF will use cryptocurrencies to fund open source technology benefiting children and young people around the world.
“This is a new and exciting venture for UNICEF,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “If digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer. That’s why the creation of our Cryptocurrency Fund is a significant and welcome step forward in humanitarian and development work."
The first contributions to the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund will be received from the Ethereum Foundation and will benefit three grantees of the UNICEF Innovation Fund ( ) – and a project coordinated by the GIGA initiative ( ) to connect schools across the world to the internet.
“The Ethereum Foundation is excited to demonstrate the power of what Ethereum and blockchain technology can do for communities around the world. Together with UNICEF, we're taking action with the Cryptofund to improve access to basic needs, rights, and resources,” said Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation. “We aim to support the research and development of the Ethereum platform, and to grow the community of those that benefit from a technology that will better countless lives and industries in the years to come. We'd like to thank UNICEF and the UNICEF family of national committees for their leadership as we create real progress together.”
The launch of the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund is part of UNICEF’s ongoing work with blockchain technology. UNICEF co-leads the UN Innovation Network with WFP. The network is responsible for researching the potential and pitfalls of blockchain and other emerging technologies.
The UNICEF Innovation Fund grantees which will receive the initial donations are Prescrypto ( ) , Atix Labs ( ) and Utopixar ( ) which work in the areas of prescription tracking, matching investors and those needing funding, and community tokens and engagement.
The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications (dapps), and together build a more globally accessible, freer and more trustworthy Internet.
UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone.----




https://psmag.com/economics/what-comes-after-bitcoin-future-of-cryptocurrency-61660

Bitcoin ( ) , a digital currency launched by the pseudonymous programmer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, hit a peak trading value of $266 per coin in April 2013, the biggest point in a bubble that would burst soon after.
The cryptocurrency, which is anonymous, untrackable, and can be used to buy illicit goods online, caught the attention of the U.S. government—and not in a good way. In May, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security froze the Wells Fargo account of Mt. Gox ( ) , the largest exchange that trades Bitcoin for other currencies, arguing that the company broke anti-money laundering laws. On June 20, the exchange suspended withdrawals from its accounts in USD, leaving users with piles of less-than-liquid Bitcoin (still worth around $95 each ( ) ).
But even as it drew political and legal controversy, Bitcoin highlighted the possibilities of a mainstream digital currency. “The current banking system sucks because it was invented 60 years ago, before the Internet was created,” Jonathan Mohan, the founder of BitcoinNYC ( ) , a digital currency-focused meet-up group, complained to me in a recent phone conversation. Cold, hard cash has inherent inefficiencies. It’s bulky and difficult to transfer between owners (wheelbarrows notwithstanding). These days, money is barely even paper bills—it’s just a number stored on a computer signifying credit or debit. Digital currencies take that idea one step further, creating self-regulating mediums of exchange through peer-to-peer networks.
Ripple ( ) is one of the main contestants for the title of Bitcoin successor. Launched by OpenCoin, a company founded by Chris Larsen in 2012, Ripple is both a currency and a payment system that promises to create a frictionless, transparent method for instantly transferring money anywhere in the world, in any currency. It’s already catching on—in May of this year, the company received investment from none other than Google Ventures. “We are doing for money what email did for communication,” Larsen wrote to me.
OpenCoin is Larsen’s third technology start-up, but each business has changed how we think of money and what can be done with it. E-Loan made credit scores free and available to customers while Prosper created an online infrastructure for making personal loans outside of the banking system. “All three companies share a common DNA—to eliminate needless waste and middlemen in the financial process,” Larsen explained.
Ripple exists in two parts: the XRP, a mathematically regulated currency unit similar to Bitcoin, and a payment system. Users have “wallets” on the Ripple system that they can add value to in any currency by means of an online exchange backed by a bank, like Bitstamp ( ) (Mt. Gox doesn’t deal in XRP). Once the wallet is full, that value can be transferred to any other user on the Ripple network in any currency in seconds. Bitcoin transactions, in comparison, can often take minutes to verify.
When transferring money between currencies in today’s normal international banking system, the value has to move through several entities like banks and exchanges before it gets to the end user, and each middleman takes a cut of the value. Ripple minimizes that process to one step, moving effortlessly between USD, Yen, Bitcoin, XRP, or even Icelandic Krona with just one exchange. The only charge is a tiny fraction of an XRP (currently worth slightly more than a penny ( ) ), which guards against the kind of large-scale cyber attacks that have disrupted Bitcoin.
Ripple’s potential is to make businesses like Western Union, which charges an average of 10.8 percent in money transfer fees, obsolete, giving a capital influx to countries that depend on worker remittances. It could also subsume Bitcoin itself. On July 2, OpenCoin announced that Ripple holders can send money to Bitcoin users in any currency, and they will receive it in Bitcoins. The move provides access to the Bitcoin economy for the newer currency, and also creates a simple bridge between Bitcoin and other non-digital currencies.
Like Ripple, MintChip ( ) is a digital currency designed to make monetary exchanges smoother—but it’s run by a government rather than a private company. The Royal Canadian Mint says that its new system is “better than cash,” but it’s actually a technology-enabled equivalent of the Canadian dollar. Like an official version of Bitcoin, MintChip “operates without the need for personal identification, is instantaneous and does not have any age or credit requirements for use,” Marc Brule, the RCM’s chief financial officer, recently noted ( ). “MintChip could be the digital equivalent of cash for online transactions.”
Each currency has its strengths and weaknesses. Overseen by a government, MintChip certainly can’t match Bitcoin’s anonymity or its utility for buying illegal goods. Nor does Ripple provide a “solution without an agenda,” Mohan critiqued, because it’s controlled by a for-profit business rather than mathematics. Some have even suggested that Ripple’s owners are hoarding the currency ( ). Created by Charles Lee in 2011, Litecoin ( ) is the frontrunner for a Bitcoin successor that remains wholly independent.
“We wanted to make a coin that is silver to Bitcoin's gold,” Lee explained ( ) in his post launching the currency. In order to discover new Bitcoins, users must “mine” them with high-end computer equipment by solving complex equations. Litecoins, currently worth around $2.80 each ( ) , are easily mined by any normal computer set-up, and the currency has more coins in circulation than Bitcoin, with an 84 million cap versus Bitcoin’s 21 million. This accessibility, along with its increased transaction speeds and better encryption, means that Litecoin might have an easier time of being adopted by more mainstream users.
These examples are just the most prominent in a sea of obscure cryptocurrencies. There’s DYM ( ) , a Ripple-based currency that uses pre-1965 U.S. silver dimes for backing, and Feathercoin ( ) , which Mohan described as the “copper to Litecoin’s silver.” Freicoin ( ) augments Bitcoin with a charge that mounts the more time you don’t spend currency, the reverse of gaining interest from savings.
Despite roadblocks and competition, there’s also a chance that Bitcoin is simply the best in the field. Every currency depends on its users’ trust for legitimacy, and Bitcoin still has the largest fan base by a long shot.
No matter what denomination they come in, now that cryptocurrencies have broken into the mainstream, they’re not going back. What remains to be seen is which currency will emerge victorious: Bitcoin, Ripple, or a future, government-controlled digital payment structure. The competition could be a good thing. “Technology has revolutionized communication, health care, and dozens of other industries ... but our underlying financial infrastructure has hardly changed,” OpenCoin’s Chris Larsen argued. “We are finally evolving.”
The International Astronomical Union has established a committee to finalize a list of official star names. Some companies offer unofficial naming rights for purchase. But the voices of certain communities are often left behind.----

The live *Ethereum price today* is $2,378.19 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $20,900,946,315 USD. We update our ETH to USD price in real-time. Ethereum is down 12.44% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #2, with a live market cap of $284,693,178,809 USD. It has a circulating supply of 119,709,824 ETH coins and the max. supply is not available.
If you would like to know where to buy Ethereum , the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in Ethereum stock are currently Binance ( ) , OKX ( ) , FTX ( ) , DigiFinex ( ) , and BitCoke ( ). You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page ( ).
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain ( ) system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies ( ) , as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts ( ).
Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering ( ) (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment ( ) (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.
The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork ( ).
Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.
* Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin ( ) is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.
* British programmer Gavin Wood ( ) is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.
Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson ( ) , who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin ( ) , a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.
Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.
Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.
In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT ( ) , LINK ( ) and BNB ( ). Since the emergence of Play2Earn ( ) games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the ETH to PHP price ( ).
As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork.
The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins.
With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion.
EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time.
In 2022, Ethereum plans to switch to proof-of-stake ( ) with its Ethereum 2.0 update ( ). This switch has been in the Ethereum roadmap since the network's inception and would see a new consensus mechanism ( ) , as well as introduce sharding ( ) as a scaling solution. The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains.
In late 2021, Ethereum's Arrow Glacier update ( ) was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's endgame ( ) to be shaped by optimistic rollups ( ) and Zk-rollups ( ).
In September 2021, there were around 117.5 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.
The remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.
In the August 2021 Ethereum network upgrade, the London hard fork contained the Ethereum Improvement Protocol ( ) , EIP-1559. Instead of the first-price auction mechanism where the highest bidder wins, EIP-1559 introduces a “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. Users that want to have their transaction prioritized can pay a “tip” or “priority fee” to miners. As the base fee adjusts dynamically with transaction activity, this reduces the volatility of Ethereum gas fees, although it does not reduce the price, which is notoriously high during peak congestion on the network.
One of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s economics is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers justify ( ) this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via consensus ( ) allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.
With the introduction of EIP-1559 however, the base fees used in transactions are burned, removing the ETH from circulation. This means higher activity on the network would lead to more ETH burned, and the decreasing supply should lead to appreciation of Ethereum price, all things equal. This has the potential to make Ethereum deflationary, something ETH holders are excited about — a potential appreciation in Ethereum price today.
After the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (32 ETH is required to activate validator software) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, thus helping to secure the network by storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. At the time of writing in mid-September 2021, the Ethereum price now for 32 Ether is roughly $116,029. The amount of money earned by Ethereum validators right now is a return of 6% APR, which equates to around 1.91952 ETH, or $6960 in Ethereum price today. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase.
Ethereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards were at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually.
The minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed.
Given the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to buy Ethereum ( ) , or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges. Some of the largest markets include:

https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/

Ethereum ( ) is a blockchain-based software platform that can be used for sending and receiving value globally with its native cryptocurrency, ether, without any third-party interference. But it can also do much more than that.
First proposed in 2013 by Russian-Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin ( ) , Ethereum was designed to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing developers to create their own special applications. Unlike traditional apps, these Ethereum-based applications, called “decentralized applications,” or dapps, are self-executing thanks to the use of smart contracts.
Smart contracts are code-based programs that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and automatically carry out certain functions when predetermined conditions are met. That can be anything from sending a transaction when a certain event takes place or loaning funds once collateral is deposited into a designated wallet. The smart contracts form the basis of all dapps built on Ethereum, as well as all other dapps created across other blockchain platforms.
In August 2014, Ethereum launched its native token, ether, through an initial coin offering ( ) ( ICO ( ) ). Some 50 million ETHs were sold at a price of $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 million for the project.
According to the project’s official website, ( ) the annual inflation rate of ether is about 4.5%. Block rewards have been reduced two times since the first ever Ethereum block was mined. That block is known as the genesis block. The reductions in block rewards aren’t programmed into Ethereum’s code like Bitcoin’s halving events are. Instead, members of the community propose changes, called “Ethereum Improvement Proposals,” or EIPs, and the rest of the community votes on whether to include the proposals in updates to Ethereum’s software code. Here is a breakdown of ether’s issuance schedule to date.
The issuance rate is also affected by a feature known as the “difficulty bomb.” This refers to a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining on the original Ethereum blockchain (prior to the transition to the proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. See below).
Increasing mining difficulty lengthens the time it takes for miners to discover new blocks. That means less ether enters circulation in the form of block rewards, which in turn tapers overall issuance. This mechanism was activated, reset and delayed several times between 2017 and 2020, mainly because Ethereum developers needed more time to work on key updates ahead of the 2.0 upgrade ( ).
From ether’s official launch date in 2014 to March 2017, the token’s price remained rangebound between $0.70 and $21. It wasn’t until the 2017 bull crypto market started to pick up in May of that year that ETH price went above $100 for the first time. From there, ether skyrocketed to a peak of $414 in June 2017 before correcting. It took another five months for bullish momentum to regain strength. By that point, the entire crypto market was starting to experience huge buying pressure, which elevated almost every crypto token to new highs. By January 2018, ETH’s price peaked at $1,418 before it fell sharply.
It took about three years for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (behind bitcoin) to retest its previous all-time high price. Between February and May 2021, eth’s price more than tripled to set a new all-time high of $4,379.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has its own blockchain where a global network of more than 2.4 million computers ( ) known as “nodes” maintains a record of transactions. Anyone can run an Ethereum node and participate in validating the network provided they have the right hardware, knowledge and time ( ) to commit to it.
Full nodes: These copy and verify all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as execute smart contract instructions known as opcodes. Full nodes shouldn’t be confused with miners (see example below).
Light nodes: These maintain only a partial record of the blockchain and request the rest of the data from full nodes. As the name suggests, these nodes can run on lighter devices such as mobile phones and don’t need to operate 
Full archive nodes: These store the entire history of the Ethereum blockchain, including previous “states” – or the information on the blockchain – and are used for tools like block explorers.
An easy way to understand the difference between miners and full nodes is to think of miners as archaeologists out in the field uncovering historical artifacts and full nodes as administrators at a national museum who maintain a record of all the archaeologists’ findings.
The Ethereum blockchain relies on miners to discover new blocks. These are like digital boxes that store transaction information and other data. Miners compete using specialized computing equipment to win the chance to be the next person to add a block to the chain and get rewarded with transaction fees (from the transactions they add to the block) and “block rewards.”
Block rewards are new ether coins that are created when each new block is discovered and are given to the successful miner for their efforts. Once a block is added, the rest of the mining network verifies it to make sure the balances are correct and the transaction isn’t a “double-spend,” i.e., someone isn’t trying to spend money they don’t have. Full nodes then make a record of the final data.
However, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum full nodes also need to keep track of the state (the current information) of all of these applications, including each user’s balance, all the smart contract code, where it’s all stored and any changes that are made. This means running an Ethereum node requires significantly more storage and is expensive to run compared with a bitcoin node.
Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and acts as the primary “fuel” that powers all activity on it. “Gas” refers to an amount of ether that’s needed to perform a certain function on the network, such as:
Smart contracts can be written using several high-level programming languages such as C++ and JavaScript, but the most popular is called “Solidity,” which was created by Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum’s co-founders and the project’s first chief technology officer.
These contracts then have to be converted from high-level languages (that humans can understand) to low-level languages (that a machine can understand). That’s because a computer environment called the “Ethereum Virtual Machine,” or EVM, is where all smart contracts are deployed and executed. This EVM is built into every full Ethereum node and can carry out more than 140 different operation codes (opcodes). These are essentially machine instructions that can be strung together to perform virtually any task, which is what the term “Turing-complete” refers to.
The advent of smart contracts has led to the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations ( ) (DAOs) and an entire decentralized finance ecosystem, or “ DeFi ( ) ,” where traditional financial services such as lending and providing insurance can now be accessed through peer-to-peer powered dapps.
Ethereum token standards are the blueprints for creating tokens that are compatible with the broader Ethereum network ( ). These include tokens that can be traded for one another (fungible) as well as tokens that are inherently unique and cannot be mutually exchanged (NFTs). Ethereum token standards were invented by Ethereum developers to help users create new digital currencies more easily, faster and cheaper than starting from scratch.
Ethereum 2.0, also known as “Serenity,” is a major upgrade that aims to make the world’s second-largest crypto project faster, more efficient and more scalable by migrating the network from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system.
Dubbed “Casper,” Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system involves users of the network locking up their coins to become network contributors, as opposed to using expensive, energy-intensive mining equipment. Each staker is required to lock up 32 ethers or to join a staking pool and combine their ether with others to participate in creating new blocks on the Ethereum PoS blockchain. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is rolling out in multiple phases. The initial ones include:
Phase 0 launched in December 2020, and the Beacon is a separate Ethereum blockchain that introduced a proof-of-stake system. It’s also responsible for new block creation, transaction verification, staking rewards and managing new Ethereum blockchains called “shard chains.”
In the next major phase of development, Ethereum’s Beacon chain will be bridged to the main Ethereum network and will replace the current, energy-intensive proof-of-work system with proof-of-stake. Network stakeholders known as “validators” will begin producing blocks, verifying transactions and managing the security of the blockchain in place of miners after Ethereum and Eth 2.0 are merged.
After the merge, there will be additional, smaller upgrades needed. The next task for Ethereum developers will be enabling sharding, which creates multiple mini-blockchains. Each shard will be responsible for verifying its own set of transactions rather than the entire network verifying every single transaction. The Beacon chain will act as the main coordinator between these shards, randomly assigning validators to each.
With PoS and sharding both enabled, Ethereum developers expect that they will make further tweaks to enhance the security of the network. That includes adding anonymity features to conceal validator identities behind block proposals. It also includes leveraging new technologies such as the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) ( ) to further secure the randomness of validator assignments and make it harder for malicious actors to disrupt the network.
In November 2013, he released the Ethereum white paper ( ) – a technical document that outlined the vision and technology behind the proposed project. A month later, Buterin asked Israeli-American Amir Chetrit to join his project. The two had worked together on a separate project called “ Colored Coins ( ) ” – which subsequently laid the foundations for the NFT market.
Not long after publishing the white paper, Buterin attended a Bitcoin conference in Miami, where he met a number of interested developers and investors who joined the Ethereum project as co-founders. Those included Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio and Charles Hoskinson
Joseph Lubin, Jeffrey Wilcke and Wood were introduced later as the project’s last three co-founders. Together, the eight-member team formed an entity known as the Ethereum Foundation – a Switzerland-based nonprofit organization. A dispute between Hoskinson and Buterin over whether Ethereum should be a for-profit company, led to Hoskinson leaving the project.

https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/

Ethereum's Monetary Policy is defined by the rewards that are paid out by the protocol at any given time. Ethereum's current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5% with 2 Ether per block and an additional 1.75 Ether per uncle block (plus fees) being rewarded to miners.
Ethereum does not have a fixed supply because a fixed supply would also require a fixed security budget for the Ethereum network. Rather than arbitrarily fix Ethereum's security, Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as "minimum issuance to secure the network".
Ethereum has had a history of reducing issuance to these estimated minimums and the network has never increased issuance. The move to proof-of-stake is also part of Ethereum's effort to reduce issuance to minimum amounts without sacrificing security.
As Ethereum is a decentralized network, the Monetary Policy cannot be successfully modified unless there is overwhelming consensus from the aforementioned stakeholders. Ethereum follows an off-chain governance ( ) process meaning that any and all decisions on changes to the network happen extra-protocol.
That said, due to natural incentives, Ether's issuance is unlikely to ever increase unless the security of the network is at risk. Additionally, the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake transition will progressively allow for a drastic reduction of Ether issuance while maintaining the same level of network security.
As part of the Ethereum genesis block, initial contributors to Ethereum sale were allocated 60,000,000 Ether. Another 12,000,000 Ether was given to the development fund which was distributed among early contributors and the Ethereum Foundation.
Every block produced on the Ethereum network has an associated block reward which incentivizes miners to support the network. On top of the base block reward, miners that find an uncle block ( ) receive ~75% of the current block reward. This results in a growing supply of Ether across time. The history of the block reward are as follows:
* In mid 2017, a mechanism called the difficulty bomb (or "Ethereum Ice Age") started to kick in. This meant that the difficulty of mining a block rose, therefore slowing down blocks. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in issuance rate.
According to the current Eth 2.0 spec ( ) , issuance rate will be greatly reduced as a part of Proof of Stake. There will be a sliding scale between total amount of Ether at stake and annual interest earned by stakers. The current spec would produce the following annual interest and inflation numbers based on total network stake:
* Eth2 Phase 1.5 ( ) : PoW rewards will be removed due to Eth1 PoW chain being moved into a shard ( ) on the Eth2 chain. This means that the only rewards on chain will be to PoS validators, using the chart above.----




https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-649.md

The average block times are increasing due to the difficulty bomb (also known as the " ice age ") slowly accelerating. This EIP proposes to delay the difficulty bomb for approximately one and a half year and to reduce the block rewards with the Byzantium fork, the first part of the Metropolis fork.
Starting with BYZANTIUM_FORK_BLKNUM the client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting around 3 million blocks later than previously specified with the Homestead fork. Furthermore, block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 3 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly.
The Casper development and switch to proof-of-stake is delayed, the Ethash proof-of-work should be feasible for miners and allow sealing new blocks every 15 seconds on average for another one and a half years. With the delay of the ice age, there is a desire to not suddenly also increase miner rewards. The difficulty bomb has been known about for a long time and now it's going to stop from happening. In order to maintain stability of the system, a block reward reduction that offsets the ice age delay would leave the system in the same general state as before. Reducing the reward also decreases the likelihood of a miner driven chain split as Ethereum approaches proof-of-stake.
This will delay the ice age by 42 million seconds (approximately 1.4 years), so the chain would be back at 30 second block times at the end of 2018. An alternate proposal was to add special rules to the difficulty calculation to effectively pause the difficulty between different blocks. This would lead to similar results.
This was previously discussed at All Core Devs Meeting #09 ( ) , #12 ( ) , #13 ( ) , and #14 ( ). Consensus on the specification was achieved in All Core Devs Meeting #19 ( ) and specification drafted in EIP issue #649 ( ). It was decided to replace EIP #186 ( ) and include the block reward reduction along with the difficulty bomb delay in All Core Devs Meeting #20 ( ) and #21 ( ) ; accepted in #22 ( ).
This EIP is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities in the difficulty calculation, as well as the block, uncle and nephew reward structure. Therefore, it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number. It's suggested to include this EIP in the first of the two Metropolis hard-forks, the Byzantium fork.----

The average block times are increasing due to the difficulty bomb (also known as the " ice age ") slowly accelerating. This EIP proposes to delay the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months and to reduce the block rewards with the Constantinople fork, the second part of the Metropolis fork.
Starting with CNSTNTNPL_FORK_BLKNUM the client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting around 5 million blocks later than previously specified with the Homestead fork. Furthermore, block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 2 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly.

https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/mining.html

Solo mining, where the miner attempts to generate new blocks on his own, with the proceeds from the block reward and transaction fees going entirely to himself, allowing him to receive large payments with a higher variance (longer time between payments)
Pooled mining, where the miner pools resources with other miners to find blocks more often, with the proceeds being shared among the pool miners in rough correlation to the amount of hashing power they each contributed, allowing the miner to receive small payments with a lower variance (shorter time between payments).
As illustrated below, solo miners typically use bitcoind to get new transactions from the network ( ). Their mining software periodically polls bitcoind for new transactions using the “getblocktemplate” RPC ( ) , which provides the list of new transactions plus the public key to which the coinbase transaction should be sent.
The mining software constructs a block using the template (described below) and creates a block header. It then sends the 80-byte block header to its mining hardware (an ASIC) along with a target threshold (difficulty setting). The mining hardware iterates through every possible value for the block header nonce and generates the corresponding hash.
If none of the hashes are below the threshold, the mining hardware gets an updated block header with a new merkle root from the mining software; this new block header is created by adding extra nonce data to the coinbase field of the coinbase transaction.
On the other hand, if a hash is found below the target threshold, the mining hardware returns the block header with the successful nonce to the mining software. The mining software combines the header with the block and sends the completed block to bitcoind to be broadcast to the network ( ) for addition to the block chain.
Pool miners follow a similar workflow, illustrated below, which allows mining pool operators to pay miners based on their share of the work done. The mining pool gets new transactions from the network ( ) using bitcoind. Using one of the methods discussed later, each miner’s mining software connects to the pool and requests the information it needs to construct block headers.
In pooled mining, the mining pool sets the target threshold a few orders of magnitude higher (less difficult) than the network ( ) difficulty. This causes the mining hardware to return many block headers which don’t hash to a value eligible for inclusion on the block chain but which do hash below the pool’s target, proving (on average) that the miner checked a percentage of the possible hash values.
The miner then sends to the pool a copy of the information the pool needs to validate that the header will hash below the target and that the block of transactions referred to by the header merkle root field is valid for the pool’s purposes. (This usually means that the coinbase transaction must pay the pool.)
The information the miner sends to the pool is called a share because it proves the miner did a share of the work. By chance, some shares the pool receives will also be below the network ( ) target—the mining pool sends these to the network ( ) to be added to the block chain.
The block reward and transaction fees that come from mining that block are paid to the mining pool. The mining pool pays out a portion of these proceeds to individual miners based on how many shares they generated. For example, if the mining pool’s target threshold is 100 times lower than the network ( ) target threshold, 100 shares will need to be generated on average to create a successful block, so the mining pool can pay of its payout for each share received. Different mining pools use different reward distribution systems based on this basic share system.
In both solo and pool mining, the mining software needs to get the information necessary to construct block headers. This subsection describes, in a linear way, how that information is transmitted and used. However, in actual implementations, parallel threads and queuing are used to keep ASIC hashers working at maximum capacity.
The simplest and earliest method was the now-deprecated Bitcoin Core getwork RPC ( ) , which constructs a header for the miner directly. Since a header only contains a single 4-byte nonce good for about 4 gigahashes, many modern miners need to make dozens or hundreds of getwork requests a second. Solo miners may still use getwork on v0.9.5 or below, but most pools today discourage or disallow its use.
A complete dump of the transactions bitcoind or the mining pool suggests including in the block, allowing the mining software to inspect the transactions, optionally add additional transactions, and optionally remove non-required transactions.
Using the transactions received, the mining software adds a nonce to the coinbase extra nonce field and then converts all the transactions into a merkle tree to derive a merkle root it can use in a block header. Whenever the extra nonce field needs to be changed, the mining software rebuilds the necessary parts of the merkle tree and updates the time and merkle root fields in the block header.
Like all bitcoind RPCs ( ) , “getblocktemplate” ( ) is sent over HTTP. To ensure they get the most recent work, most miners use HTTP longpoll ( ) to leave a “getblocktemplate” ( ) request open at all times. This allows the mining pool to push a new “getblocktemplate” ( ) to the miner as soon as any miner on the peer-to-peer network ( ) publishes a new block or the pool wants to send more transactions to the mining software.
The parts of the merkle tree which need to be re-hashed to create a new merkle root when the coinbase transaction is updated with a new extra nonce. The other parts of the merkle tree, if any, are not sent, effectively limiting the amount of data which needs to be sent to (at most) about a kilobyte at current transaction volume.
Using the coinbase transaction received, the mining software adds a nonce to the coinbase extra nonce field, hashes the coinbase transaction, and adds the hash to the received parts of the merkle tree. The tree is hashed as necessary to create a merkle root, which is added to the block header information received. Whenever the extra nonce field needs to be changed, the mining software updates and re-hashes the coinbase transaction, rebuilds the merkle root, and updates the header merkle root field.
Unlike “getblocktemplate” ( ) , miners using Stratum cannot inspect or add transactions to the block they’re currently mining. Also unlike “getblocktemplate” ( ) , the Stratum protocol uses a two-way TCP socket directly, so miners don’t need to use HTTP longpoll to ensure they receive immediate updates from mining pools when a new block is broadcast to the peer-to-peer network ( ).
*Resources:* The GPLv3 BFGMiner ( ) mining software and AGPLv3 Eloipool ( ) mining pool software are widely-used among miners and pools. The libblkmaker ( ) C library and python-blkmaker ( ) library, both MIT licensed, can interpret GetBlockTemplate for your programs.----




https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/litecoin-vs-bitcoin-blockchain

Litecoin (LTC) was created in 2011 in an effort to introduce a cryptocurrency with increased accessibility and transaction throughput that would be better suited for payments to serve as a complement to Bitcoin’s more natural utility as a store of value. As such, the Litecoin vs. Bitcoin narrative oversimplifies the relationship — more accurately, Litecoin has become the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.
Litecoin (LTC) was one of the earliest altcoins ( ) to emerge on the cryptocurrency scene, just a few years after Satoshi’s whitepaper ( ) ushered in a new financial and technological paradigm with Bitcoin ( ). I became interested in Bitcoin earlier that year and quickly realized that one of its major drawbacks was speed. A new block ( ) is added to the Bitcoin blockchain approximately every ten minutes and, thinking of a future where this incredible new technology would be widely adopted, I realized right away that transaction throughput would become a serious scalability ( ) problem for the nascent cryptocurrency. I immediately began working on a solution to complement Bitcoin and in only a week, Litecoin was born.
Litecoin was created from a copy of Bitcoin’s source code — as opposed to forking ( ) it from the Bitcoin blockchain ( ) — which makes Litecoin an entirely new blockchain without a shared genesis block ( ). Litecoin is technically very similar to Bitcoin but has a few crucial differences. Specifically, Litcoin features:
Both Litecoin and Bitcoin use Proof of Work ( ) (PoW) as their consensus method. Miners ( ) of both cryptocurrencies race to complete extremely challenging math puzzles using a hash algorithm ( ) in order to achieve consensus throughout their respective networks, win the right to add blocks of valid transactions to their blockchains, and earn block rewards ( ).
Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 ( ) hashing function to power PoW on the Bitcoin network. The devices that miners use to complete these extremely challenging math puzzles are computers that vary significantly with respect to their design and configuration. Initially, the core machinery used for Bitcoin mining relied on a central processing unit (CPU), which you can think of as the backbone of a regular computer, more or less. Because PoW is a competition, miners quickly began looking for an edge and began bolstering their CPUs’ processing power by pairing them with a graphics processing unit (GPU), which alleviates a large chunk of the processing burden from the main CPU to increase the device's overall processing output.
And, as most competitions tend to go, new technology was developed strictly for the purposes of Bitcoin mining. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are highly specialized devices that excel at mining and almost always outperform their CPU and GPU counterparts. They’re also expensive, difficult to maintain, and require specialized knowledge — factors that tend to deter many people from operating them. With fewer people with the knowledge, time, and capital to acquire, configure, and maintain ASICs, mining on the Bitcoin network has become more centralized and exclusive, which compromises the security and resilience of the network.
Litecoin was developed to use the Scrypt ( ) hashing algorithm, which is a memory-intensive algorithm that was designed to deter GPUs and ASICs. The goal was to make the Litecoin network more accessible to individuals, who are the biggest proponents of the coin. So it was extremely important for individuals to be able to mine litecoin with their CPUs in the beginning. In time, Scrypt-capable ASICs were created and now virtually all Litecoin mining is done using this hardware.
On average, new blocks on the Litecoin network are generated every 2.5 minutes, which is four times faster than Bitcoin, where blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Consequently, Litecoin’s transaction throughput is also roughly four times faster than Bitcoin’s. For each block generated on the Litecoin blockchain, miners are rewarded with a predetermined amount of LTC, known as a block reward. As time goes on, the block reward is gradually reduced by increments of 50% in a process known as halving ( ).
To compensate for Litecoin’s faster block time, the interval between halvings was extended. Whereas Bitcoin has a block reward halving every 210,000 blocks, Litecoin’s halving takes place every 840,000 blocks. This 4x increase in blocks per halving period means that Litecoin generates four blocks for every one block that Bitcoin generates. Theoretically, this compensation mechanism should keep Litecoin and Bitcoin on a similar trajectory, with a halving event taking place every four years for both cryptocurrencies. The math also reveals that there will ultimately be a greater total number of LTC than BTC — 84 million versus 21 million.
With faster block times and higher transaction throughput, Litecoin was built to be a more practical and scalable medium of exchange, whereas Bitcoin has grown more into a store of value. Litecoin’s similarities to Bitcoin also make it a viable testnet ( ) for the Bitcoin protocol, as evidenced by its early adoption, and Bitcoin’s subsequent adoption, of the SegWit ( ) soft fork.
Litecoin is now one of the most recognized, trusted, and used blockchain-based payment networks in the world, and many now agree that Litecoin is a complement to Bitcoin, not a competitor: Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.

https://polkadot.network/

Polkadot enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with a wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network.
Polkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set of validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.
Create a custom blockchain in minutes using the Substrate ( ) framework. Connect your chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one. This ease of development helps Polkadot's network grow.
Polkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional blockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) model. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year, Polkadot has the lowest carbon footprint ( ) among proof-of-stake protocols analyzed in recent research ( ).
Polkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice. Network upgrades are coordinated on-chain and enacted autonomously and without forking the network, ensuring that Polkadot’s development remains future-proof and community-driven.
Polkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners, will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.
Game theory incentivizes token holders to behave in honest ways. Good actors are rewarded by this mechanism whilst bad actors will lose their stake in the network. This ensures the network stays secure.

https://www.getmonero.org/resources/about/

Monero was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the CryptoNote reference code. There was no premine or instamine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread here. ( ) The founder, thankful_for_today, proposed some controversial changes that the community disagreed with. A fallout ensued, and the Monero Core Team forked the project with the community following this new Core Team. This Core Team has provided oversight since.
Monero has made several large improvements since launch. The blockchain was migrated to a different database structure to provide greater efficiency and flexibility, minimum ring signature sizes were set so that all transactions were private by mandate, and RingCT was implemented to hide the transaction amounts. Nearly all improvements have provided improvements to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.
Users must be able to trust Monero with their transactions, without risk of error or attack. Monero gives the full block reward to the miners, who are the most critical members of the network who provide this security. Transactions are cryptographically secure using the latest and most resilient encryption tools available.
Monero takes privacy seriously. Monero needs to be able to protect users in a court of law and, in extreme cases, from the death penalty. This level of privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically competent or have no idea how Monero works. A user needs to confidently trust Monero in a way that this person does not feel pressured into changing their spending habits for risk of others finding out.
Monero is committed to providing the highest degree of decentralization in both network security and code development. Its Proof of Work algorithm prevents specialized mining hardware from dominating the network and allows for fair distribution of block rewards. Additionally, Monero's development and research are conducted via global collaboration, and the project is carried out with utmost transparency. Each development decision is open to public discussion, and every major developer meeting is published online.
Monero uses randomx ( ) , an ASIC-resistant and CPU-friendly POW algorithm created by Monero community members, designed to make the use of mining-specific hardware unfeasible. Monero previously used CryptoNight and variations of this algorithm. More info in the GitHub repo ( ).
To make sure there will always be an incentive to mine Monero and keep it safe, the emission is infinite. There are two main emissions: first, main curve: ~18.132 million coins by the end of May 2022, then, tail curve: 0.6 XMR per 2-minute block, kicks in once main emission is done, translates to <1% inflation decreasing over time ( Tail Emission ( ) ).----




https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/fungibility.html

Fungibility means that two units of a currency can be mutually substituted and the substituted currency is equal to another unit of the same size. For example, two $10 bills can be exchanged and they are functionally identical to any other $10 bill in circulation (although $10 bills have unique ID numbers and are therefore not completely fungible). Gold is probably a closer example of true fungibility, where any 1 oz. of gold of the same grade is worth the same as another 1 oz. of gold. Monero is fungible due to the nature of the currency which provides no way to link transactions together nor trace the history of any particular XMR. 1 XMR is functionally identical to any other 1 XMR.
Fungibility is an advantage Monero has over Bitcoin and almost every other cryptocurrency, due to the privacy inherent in the Monero blockchain ( ) and the permanently traceable nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. With Bitcoin, any BTC can be tracked by anyone back to its creation coinbase transaction ( ). Therefore, if a coin has been used for an illegal purpose in the past, this history will be contained in the blockchain ( ) in perpetuity. This lack of fungibility means that certain businesses will be obligated to avoid accepting BTC that have been previously used for purposes which are illegal, or simply run afoul of their Terms of Service. Currently some large Bitcoin companies are blocking, suspending, or closing accounts that have received Bitcoin used in online gambling or other purposes deemed unsavory by said companies.
Monero has been built specifically to address the problem of traceability and non-fungibility inherent in other cryptocurrencies. By having completely private transactions Monero is truly fungible and there can be no blacklisting of certain XMR, while at the same time providing all the benefits of a secure, decentralized, permanent blockchain.----




http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source

I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:
The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital signatures. A digital coin contains the public key of its owner. To transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of the next owner. Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big problem unsolved: double-spending. Any owner could try to re-spend an already spent coin by signing it again to another owner. The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.
Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle. For details on how it works, see the design paper at pdf
The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.
A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.
we are actually really talking about the old Chaumian central stuff. That was because a) it was there b) it was patent free (we have to think a bit about the US). I had a read of your paper on the weekend - thanks a lot for doing that work. Interesting read.
Or the other way around: if you don't trust the double spending database, because its a central instance, you surely couldn't trust a central issuer to issue and redeem. How would a currency work otherwise? Would you use it for a mutual credit system in which the transactions are shown online?
As far as I understand, there will be a limit of the total amount of tokens that can be created, and a changing gradient of difficulty in making the tokens, where the elaboration gets more and more difficult with time. Is that correct?
It is important that there be a limit in the amount of But it is also important that this limit be adjustable to take account of how many people adopt the system. If the number of users changes with time, it will also be necessary to change the total amount of coins.
In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.
This would mean that - the earlier someone gets in on the bitcoin system establishing a node, the more chance they have of becoming lucky and being able to generate coins. Nothing against that, it would work to promote adoption of the system.
This way, you have two parameters that keep a balance. One is the halving of coins given per block, the other is a continual (or periodic?) adjustment of the target total of coins to the number of active users. That should self-balance the system.
The reason balance of the system is important: if it's going to be used for payments, you don't want to have large changes in the value of the coins. It would lead to distortions, I believe, by continually increasing the "purchasing power" of a single coin.
The London Mint was unable to make enough small coins in Isaac Newton's day. Private minters stepped in. If bitcoin can't make enough coins and small enough coins so that people can trade at the value they want, then it will be replaced by something that can.
It is based on cash. Therefore the problem of "trust" is not solved. However, we do not have a central bank giving money as credit, but here, every single issuer of his own money gets it printed himself. So Rheingold is rather a group of many de-central-banks. Therefore the seignorage everybody gains himself.
I would like to promote your project on our blog Maybe you could even become Rheingolder yourself with your own cashbill. Since we pretend to be an art-project, the whole project will be shown in a museum in future. We already have more than 1.000 members, mostly in Germany. Our website de
As far as I can understand it we are dealing here with another glorified form of LETS, or CCs in electronic form ofcourse. The question is this. How will this help to change the big issues of our world such as global warming, food security, population, et al? This is what really matters at the end of the day. Moreover, whether we like it, or not ,we still have to deal with the "big boys" (ie. governments, corporations, banks,et al) at some point.----




http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/the-bitcoin-economy-is-collapsing-with-no-sign-of-recovery/243253/

BitcoinCharts-Post.jpg ( ) When Daily Beast's Dan Lyons wrote ( ) about Bitcoins back in mid-June, that was a sure sign the digital currency had reached the mainstream. Now many readers -- from 70-year-old retirees to those drawn in by the newsweekly's cover that issue -- who might otherwise never have heard about Bitcoins, were aware of this completely anonymous form of money.
In that brief piece, Lyons lionized Bitcoins. "For the first time, you can buy anything online without giving your credit-card numbers or bank-account information -- leaving no trace at all," he wrote. But maybe the long-time technology reporter was too late to this story. It looks like the age of the Bitcoin could already be nearing its end.
Earlier this year, the price of the Bitcoin climbed to a high of $32. It then fell to about $18, which is where it stood when Lyons wrote his piece. But then it continued to fall. Just this past week, the first of August, the exchange rate dropped from $13.50 to under $7, as the chart embedded above shows. And it looks like it will continue moving in a downward direction.
The problem with Bitcoins is the same thing that people love about Bitcoins: They leave no trace. It takes an incredible amount of computing power to create new Bitcoins with a PC (you can also, of course, just buy them on an exchange, which is what most people using them do). And a complicated algorithm keeps the total supply steady. Once these digital coins are created, they're still just a handful of bits and bytes, a little piece of encrypted code. There is no fundamental value.
"You can always live in a house regardless of what happens to the real estate market, so we can be confident that house prices won't fall to zero," Timothy B. Lee pointed out this weekend over at Forbes ( ). "Similarly, if the price of gold fell too much, people could always use it to make jewelry, so gold is a relatively safe investment."
But Bitcoins are nothing. You can't live in them and you can't wear them. You can't turn them into real estate or jewelry. Right now, you can use Bitcoins to buy books and computers and other goods and services, including, most famously, illegal drugs ( ). But when -- if -- the exchange rate crashes, you can bet that those merchants will stop accepting Bitcoins, that the Tor-accessed websites will shut down. "[T]here's no significant community of people who conduct commerce exclusively (or even primarily) in Bitcoins," Lee pointed out. "And this means there's no logical stopping point to Bitcoin's price decline. So far Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buying Bitcoins as the price falls, convinced that the price will go back up eventually. But as the hoped-for rally has failed to materialize, more have gotten discouraged or bored and cash out, pushing the price down further."----




http://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/

Yesterday, the Bitcoin network experienced one of the most serious hiccups that we have seen in the past four years. Starting from block 225430, the blockchain literally split into two, with one half of the network adding blocks to one version of the chain, and the other half adding to the other. For the next six hours, there were effectively two Bitcoin networks operating at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. The split lasted for 24 blocks or 6 hours, finally resolving itself when one version of the chain conclusively pulled ahead of the other at block 225454, leaving the other chain largely abandoned, with only a small number of miners that are incapable of recognizing what has now become the main chain still mining it, while the bulk of the network quickly returned to normal.
The fork was first noticed at about 23:30 GMT on Monday, March 11, when “thermoman” on the bitcoin-dev IRC channel mentioned that “some client told my client it (the other host) had 225431 blocks, but blockexplorer says that currently the block count is at 225430″. Some other blockchain resources also showed 225430 blocks. Over the course of the next thirty minutes, other users started reporting more strange reports from Bitcoin client logs. Bitcoin developer Peter Wuille (“sipa” on IRC) claimed that he was on block 225435, and then soon 225439, while other sources were still reporting 225431. At 00:00 GMT March 12, sipa posted “I wonder if there’s something that triggered it on the network, a large reorganization or so”. It turned out that a blockchain reorganization ( ) , an event that happens when a client discovers a new blockchain longer (and therefore more likely to be valid) than the one it was working with before, and switches to it, was indeed what happened, and over the next few minutes everyone realized what was going on: a blockchain fork.
What had happened was the following. The latest version 0.8 release of bitcoind, by far the most popular implementation of Bitcoin used by miners, switched the database that it used to store blocks and transactions from BerkeleyDB to the more efficient LevelDB as part of an effort to reduce blockchain synchronization time. However, what the developers did not realize at the time was that by doing so they also accidentally introduced a change to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. In order to make an update to the database, the database process must make a “lock” on the part of the database which stores that particular item of information, a mechanism implemented to prevent two changes from occurring simultaneously and accidentally corrupting the database. In a b-tree, the data structure used by BerkeleyDB to store objects, two locks are required per update. However, BerkeleyDB requires its users to set a limit to the number of locks that can be made at the same time ( ) ; “If the values are too small,” the FAQ page warns, “requests for locks in an application will fail. If the values are too large, the locking subsystem will consume more resources than is necessary.” In the case of Bitcoin, the limit was 10,000. What happened in block 225430 was that a single block simultaneously affected the status of over 5,000 transactions, requiring more than 10,000 locks on the b-tree to be made at the same time. As a result, the BerkeleyDB failed, and so the older bitcoind 0.7 (and earlier versions) could not read the block. In the case of bitcoind 0.8, LevelDB has no such restrictions, so it could accept such blocks just fine. Because the Bitcoin protocol builds up the transaction history, used primarily to calculate and agree on everyone’s account balances, by creating new blocks representing roughly ten-minute time intervals’ worth of transactions on top of existing valid blocks in a chain (hence, “blockchain”), miners using bitcoind 0.8 started building up a version of the blockchain that included the offending block, while miners using bitcoind 0.7 rejected it and started working on a another blockchain of their own. Ordinary users using BitcoinQt 0.7 or platforms that rely on bitcoind 0.7 as a server saw the 0.7 fork, and everyone else saw the 0.8 fork.
With the fork in progress, the Bitcoin developers had a choice: do they support the 0.8 fork or the 0.7 fork? Ultimately, there could only be one; a monetary system cannot function if there are two different databases of how much money each person has. The 0.8 fork had much more computing power behind it, and was already eight blocks ahead by the time the community could muster any effort toward fixing the problem, and upgrading to 0.8 is something that will have to be done eventually. On the other hand, if the 0.8 fork took over, thousands of users on 0.7 would be forced to upgrade in order to use Bitcoin at all, something which would not happen if the 0.7 fork took over since both versions of bitcoind can read it. The developers quickly settled on 0.7, and the community set to work on the next task: notifying major miners and mining pool operators of what they need to do.
Over the next few hours, nearly every major Bitcoin developer and mining pool operator joined the bitcoin-dev IRC channel. Major mining pools ( ) that were using bitcoind 0.8 shut down, downgraded to 0.7, and switched back on. Merchants were also notified; most large businesses, including BitcoinStore, BitPay, SatoshiDice and MtGox, shut down deposits to protect themselves from double spend attacks. BitPay quickly turned themselves back on once their servers were on the 0.7 fork; “safe mode alerted us there’s a problem,” BitPay’s Tony Gallippi writes. “That’s when Steve jumped on IRC to see where the consensus was going, and we were back in business very quickly.” Progress on switching hash power to 0.8 appeared to be slow at first, and at block 225451, the 0.8 chain was 13 blocks longer than 0.7. But that was the furthest that the 0.8 chain would get ahead. By then, the two chains were growing roughly in lockstep, and at about 03:30 the tipping point came. The 0.7 chain quickly caught up to being only 10 blocks behind, then 8 blocks, and at 06:19 both chains converged to the same length at block 225454, leading to nearly all remaining miners abandoning the other.
This incident will go down in history as one of the closest moments that we have come to the underlying Bitcoin protocol actually failing. But it is not the most serious breach ever made. In August 2010, a transaction in block 74638 contained two outputs summing to over 184 billion – just over 2^64 satoshis. The result was an integer overflow ( ) bug, the digital equivalent of a mechanical odometer wrapping around to zero after the car drives 999,999 kilometers.
The overflow caused the software to think that the transaction contained only a small amount of BTC while in reality the outputs together had thousands of times more than the 21 million that should ever exist. A new version of the Bitcoin software had to be published, the blockchain was forked, and a new, valid, chain overtook the old one at block 74691 – 53 blocks after the original fork. This time, it only took 24 blocks, and it was not even a life-critical threat to the system – if the developers had done nothing, then Bitcoin would have carried on nonetheless, only causing inconvenience to those bitcoind and BitcoinQt users who were on 0.7 and would have had to upgrade.
The economic damage was significant, but fairly small; the only monetary losses that have been reported are the $26,000 USD worth of mining block rewards from the 24 mined blocks of 25 BTC that are now forever lost in the now abandoned chain, as well as a $10,000 double spend ( ) against OKPay. Aside from the lost mining revenue and this double spend, transactions were not affected and no bitcoins were “lost”; any transaction that was included in the now abandoned chain was included in the new chain as well, so any bitcoins that were spent during the fork are now at their proper destinations.
In a way, this was the best possible time for such a thing to happen. The Bitcoin price was on a steady uptrend, and so the 24% drop in price ( ) that occurred at the time of the incident was quickly reversed, and as of the time of this writing Bitcoin stands at $44-$46, down from $48 the day earlier but up from $36 one week before. Public media attention on Bitcoin is very much positive, and rather than attacking Bitcoin as they would have in 2011 many journalists actually praised the Bitcoin development team on their rapid response. Ars Technica’s Timothy B Lee wrote a neutral piece ( ) on the event, writing that “the incident will be an important test of the cryptocurrency’s decentralized governance structure”, and an article at ecurrency.ec ( ) on the subject was entitled “Bitcoin software bug has been rapidly resolved”.
However, the incident opens up serious questions about the nature of the Bitcoin protocol, and puts into the spotlight some uncomfortable facts about Bitcoin’s notion of “decentralization”. Most security protocols, including encryption algorithms, hash algorithms and full-scale protocols, have dozens of implementations in many different programming languages, and the protocol specification is determined by a clear standard against which any individual implementation can be checked for compliance. In the case of Bitcoin, however, things are different. Although there is technically a standard on the Bitcoin wiki pages, it has at times been poorly updates, and the reality is that the bitcoind implementation is the standard, and nearly all miners on the Bitcoin network are using some version of it. There are a few alternative implementations, the most complete one being Amir Taaki’s libbitcoin, with Mike Hearn’s BitcoinJ ( ) (written in Java) close behind, but so far they have gained very little traction in use with mining, and, what’s more, there is a small portion of the Bitcoin development community which is actively against the idea of using multiple codebases.
Fortunately, most Bitcoin developers do not support this viewpoint, although many have come out in favor of keeping a healthy level of prudence. Mike Hearn wrote the following ( ) on the Bitcointalk forums in June 2011:
Lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen replied to another poster in the same thread: “Really? I’ve been encouraging alternative implementations, who is the power-hungry core developer?”, and in November 2012 he wrote in a Bitcoin Foundation update that “part of the solution is to encourage alternative implementations that make different tradeoffs than the reference implementation. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work on cross-implementation testing (the “testnet3″ blockchain contains hundreds of transaction validation test cases, for example), and new features are being added to the protocol to support alternative implementations”
But alternative implementations are not just useful for supporting different tradeoffs. They are also crucial in making Bitcoin’s claim of decentralization a reality. If there had instead been five distinct Bitcoin implementation in use at the time of the fork, what would have happened is that one of the five would have recognized the wrong blockchain and forked off, leading to a loss of revenue for a small number of miners and requiring the users of clients using that implementation to upgrade. The aberrant implementation’s fork of the blockchain would end up much weaker than the others right from the start, so the risk of double spend attacks would be minimal. One can argue that there will be a greater number of forking incidents with more implementations, but each one will be smaller in effect, and testing all implementations together on the testnet before release would reduce the number of bugs that slip into production software to about the same frequency as we see today.
The other aspect of Bitcoin’s decentralization that this incident calls into question is that of mining pools. The reason why the controlled switch to the 0.7 fork was even possible was that over 70% of the Bitcoin network’s hash power was controlled by a small number of mining pools and ASIC miners, and so the miners could all be individually contacted and convinced to immediately downgrade. Another article on the fork reads [Russian] ( ) : “the real problem is not even in the code supporting the Bitcoin network; bugs are everywhere. Rather, it’s the matter of who controls it. This event clearly showed that even such a well thought-out system is controlled by the will of a very small number of people – particularly, the operators of mining pools. Over 70% of new blocks right now are being found on pools, and not on individual solo miners. The underlying idea of the system was that the benevolent majority can stop a small number of attackers, but in the present time it is simply not working. The winner in a possible takeover will be the one with greater computing power, and no one else.” Bitcoin is clearly not at all the direct democracy that many of its early adherents imagined, and, some worry, if a centralized core of the Bitcoin community is powerful enough to successfully undertake these emergency measures to set right the Bitcoin blockchain, what else is it powerful enough to do? Force double spends to reverse million-dollar thefts? Block or even redirect transactions known to originate from Silk Road? Perhaps even modify Bitcoin’s sacred 21 million currency supply limit ( ) ?
However, a strong argument can be made that such fears are very unlikely to materialize. The reason why has nothing to do with the specific identities of the Bitcoin mining pool operators or the cohesiveness of the Bitcoin mining community; rather, it’s the fact that Bitcoin mining is still in fact quite decentralized; it simply is decentralized in a different way. Taking a political analogy, the closest equivalent would be a liquid democracy ( ) : a hybrid of direct and representative democracy where people can either vote for individual bills by themselves or assign politicians – with the proviso that if they do not like what a given politician is doing they can switch to assigning their voting power to someone else at any time. Back in the world of Bitcoin, although much of the Bitcoin network’s hash power is concentrated with mining pool operators in practice, every individual miner can switch from one pool to another almost instantly, so if a coalition of mining pool operators decides to start violating the Bitcoin protocol miners can simply switch to any pool that remains honest, instantly depriving the miscreants of their power. Although no mining pool has attempted to actively subvert the Bitcoin protocol so far, this kind of “voting” has been done before; in 2011, there were several incidents where the mining pool Deepbit pushed above 50% of the total network hash power, and in each case there was a mass exodus of miners toward other pools to balance things out. Although the nominal power may rest with the mining pool operators, the feedback of the community is always only one step away.
Altogether, the incident was handled very well, and all parts of the Bitcoin community should congratulate themselves for their speedy resolution of the problem and their unconditional cooperation. The Bitcoin community is not always in perfect harmony; Bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice and a number of Bitcoin developers, notably Luke Dashjr, are usually at odds over concerns that SatoshiDice’s large transaction count is bloating the Bitcoin blockchain, but yesterday differences were laid aside as the community worked together to solve the problem. We also learned a lot, and merchants are likely to be much more prepared for such incidents in the future, perhaps implementing techniques like automatic fork detection to handle forks and avoid double spends without immediate manual intervention. Before today, many people knew that some test for the Bitcoin network would come, whether at the 1 MB block size limit or else where, but just how the community would handle such a thing was an unknown. Now, the test has come and gone, and how the Bitcoin community handled the test is known to everyone: we passed with flying colors.----




https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

In a centralized economy, currency is issued by a central bank at a rate that is supposed to match the growth of the amount of goods that are exchanged so that these goods can be traded with stable prices. The monetary base ( ) is controlled by a central bank. In the United States, the Fed ( ) increases the monetary base by issuing currency, increasing the amount banks have on reserve or by a process called Quantitative Easing ( ).
In a fully decentralized monetary system, there is no central authority that regulates the monetary base. Instead, currency is created by the nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The Bitcoin generation algorithm defines, in advance, how currency will be created and at what rate. Any currency that is generated by a malicious user that does not follow the rules will be rejected by the network and thus is worthless.
Bitcoins are created each time a user discovers a new block ( ). The rate of block creation is adjusted every 2016 blocks to aim for a constant two week adjustment period (equivalent to 6 per hour.) The number of bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years. The result is that the number of bitcoins in existence will not exceed slightly less than 21 million. [2] ( #cite_note-2 ) Speculated justifications for the unintuitive value "21 million" are that it matches a 4-year reward halving schedule; or the ultimate total number of Satoshis that will be mined is close to the maximum capacity of a 64-bit floating point number. Satoshi has never really justified or explained many of these constants.
This decreasing-supply algorithm was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like gold are mined. Users who use their computers to perform calculations to try and discover a block are thus called Miners ( ).
* In Block 124724, user midnightmagic mined a solo block to himself which underpaid the reward by a single Satoshi and simultaneously destroyed the block's fees. This is one of two only known reductions in the total mined supply of Bitcoin. Therefore, from block 124724 onwards, all total supply estimates must technically be reduced by 1 Satoshi.
Because the number of bitcoins created each time a user discovers a new block - the block reward - is halved based on a fixed interval of blocks, and the time it takes on average to discover a block can vary based on mining ( ) power and the network difficulty ( ) , the exact time when the block reward is halved can vary as well. Consequently, the time the last Bitcoin will be created will also vary, and is subject to speculation based on assumptions.
If the mining power had remained constant since the first Bitcoin was mined, the last Bitcoin would have been mined somewhere near October 8th, 2140. Due to the mining power having increased overall over time, as of block 367,500 - assuming mining power remained constant from that block forward - the last Bitcoin will be mined on May 7th, 2140.
As it is very difficult to predict how mining power will evolve into the future - i.e. whether technological progress will continue to make hardware faster or whether mining will hit a a technological wall; or whether or not faster methods of SHA2 calculation will be discovered - putting an exact date or even year on this event is difficult.
The total number of bitcoins, as mentioned earlier, has an asymptote at 21 million, due to a side-effect of the data structure of the blockchain - specifically the integer storage type of the transaction output ( ) , this exact value would have been 20,999,999.9769 bitcoin. Should this technical limitation be adjusted by increasing the size of the field, the total number will still only approach a maximum of 21 million.
* In block 124724, user midnightmagic solo mined a block which caused one less Satoshi to be created than would otherwise have come into existence. Therefore, all calculations from this block onwards must now, to be accurate, include this underpay in total Bitcoins in existence. Then, in an act of sheer stupidity, a more recent miner who failed to implement RSK properly destroyed an entire block reward of 12.5 XBT in block 501726.
The bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards. At the time of writing, more than 3 out of every 4 bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined, and the annual inflation rate is just 4%. The block ( ) reward given to miners is made up of newly-created bitcoins plus transaction fees ( ). As inflation goes to zero miners will obtain an income only from transaction fees which will provide an incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible ( ).
Due to deep technical reasons, block space is a scarce commodity ( ) , getting a transaction mined can be seen as purchasing a portion of it. By analogy, on average every 10 minutes a fixed amount of land is created and no more, people wanting to make transactions bid for parcels of this land. The sale of this land is what supports the miners even in a zero-inflation regime. The price of this land is set by demand for transactions (because the supply is fixed and known) and the mining difficulty ( ) readjusts around this to keep the average interval at 10 minutes.
The theoretical total number of bitcoins, slightly less than 21 million, should not be confused with the total spendable supply. The total spendable supply is always lower than the theoretical total supply, and is subject to accidental loss, willful destruction, and technical peculiarities.
One way to see a part of the destruction of coin is by collecting a sum of all unspent transaction outputs, using a Bitcoin RPC ( ) command gettxoutsetinfo. The total_amount value returned is the sum of all outputs that the client deems technically spendable but not currently spent. Note however that this does not take into account outputs that are exceedingly unlikely to be spent as is the case in loss and destruction via constructed addresses, for example.
The algorithm which decides whether a block is valid only checks to verify whether the total amount of the reward *exceeds* the reward plus available fees. Therefore it is possible for a miner to deliberately choose to underpay himself by any value: not only can this destroy the fees involved, but also the reward itself, which can prevent the total possible bitcoins that can come into existence from reaching its theoretical maximum. This is a form of underpay which the reference implementation recognises as impossible to spend. Some of the other types below are not recognised as officially destroying Bitcoins; it is possible for example to spend the 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE if a corresponding private key is used (although this would imply that Bitcoin has been broken.)
Bitcoins may be lost if the conditions required to spend them are no longer known. For example, if you made a transaction to an address ( ) that requires a private key in order to spend those bitcoins further, had written that private key down on a piece of paper, but that piece of paper was lost. In this case, that bitcoin may also be considered lost, as the odds of randomly finding a matching private key are such that it is generally considered impossible.
A common method is to send bitcoin to an address that was constructed and only made to pass validity checks, but for which no private key is actually known. An example of such an address is "1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE", where the last "f59kuE" is text to make the preceding constructed text pass validation. Finding a matching private key is, again, generally considered impossible. For an example of how difficult this would be, see Vanitygen ( ).
Another common method is to send bitcoin in a transaction where the conditions for spending are not just unfathomably unlikely, but literally impossible to meet. For example, a transaction that is made provably unspendable using OP_RETURN ( ) , or uses script operations that requires the user to prove that 1+1 equals 3.
A lesser known method is to send bitcoin to an address based on private key that is outside the range of valid ECDSA private keys ( ). For example, the address 16QaFeudRUt8NYy2yzjm3BMvG4xBbAsBFM has a known matching private key of value 0 (zero), which is outside the valid range.
In older versions of the bitcoin reference code, a miner could make their coinbase transaction (block reward) have the exact same ID as used in a previous block [3] ( #cite_note-3 ). This effectively caused the previous block reward to become unspendable. Two known such cases [4] ( #cite_note-4 ) [5] ( #cite_note-5 ) are left as special cases in the code [6] ( #cite_note-6 ) as part of BIP 0030 ( ) changes that fixed this issue. These transactions were ₿50 each.
Because the monetary base of bitcoins cannot be expanded, the currency would be subject to severe deflation if it becomes widely used. Keynesian economists argue that deflation ( ) is bad for an economy because it incentivises individuals and businesses to save money rather than invest in businesses and create jobs. The Austrian school ( ) of thought counters this criticism, claiming that as deflation occurs in all stages of production, entrepreneurs who invest benefit from it. As a result, profit ratios tend to stay the same and only their magnitudes change. In other words, in a deflationary environment, goods and services decrease in price, but at the same time the cost for the production of these goods and services tend to decrease proportionally, effectively not affecting profits. Price deflation encourages an increase in hoarding — hence savings — which in turn tends to lower interest rates and increase the incentive for entrepreneurs to invest in projects of longer term.----




https://cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-a-deep-dive-into-crypto-s-most-notorious-ponzi-scheme

The latest ruling in the class-action lawsuit ( ) against OneCoin has dismissed Konstantin Ignatov, co-founder of OneCoin, as a defendant after he agreed to testify against his sister ( ). Ignatov is the brother of Ruja Ignatova, the infamous leader and face of OneCoin also known as “Cryptoqueen.” Ignatova disappeared in 2017 and has since managed to evade authorities and the general public.
While Ignatov was dismissed from the lawsuit initiated by defrauded OneCoin investors ( ) , court documents indicate that this same case will continue to target Ignatova. Both siblings are still the defendants in another legal action brought by the United States Department of Justice, which could see them face up to 90 years in prison ( ).
Ignatov, who was arrested on March 6, 2019 in Los Angeles, has openly spoken against his sister, claiming to have had no contact with her since her disappearance and to have hired a private investigator to find her, although without much success. On Yavin, founder and CEO of Cointelligence — a blockchain data and education resource — told Cointelegraph:
The history behind OneCoin is one filled with red flags. Founded in 2014, the Bulgaria-based company followed the typical structure of a multilevel marketing scheme — but with a twist. There were no products or memberships to be peddled; instead, there was a cryptocurrency that the promoters of OneCoin claimed to be the next Bitcoin ( BTC ( ) ).
Many in and outside of the cryptocurrency community saw through this scam. Those familiar with the MLM model were quick to see the similarities in its operation and marketing, and those familiar with crypto could clearly see that there was no blockchain or network. The OneCoin cryptocurrency was all but imaginary. Exposés of the multibillion-dollar pyramid scheme were also published in several outlets, including Cointelegraph, which reported on it back in 2015 ( ). Several institutions and government agencies were also quick to issue warnings about OneCoin.
Nevertheless, the company became extremely popular throughout the years, selling membership packages that supposedly contained OneCoin tokens and the ability to mine more. These could be exchanged for fiat currency on the private exchange Xcoinx, but members could only sell a limited amount determined by the membership package bought. This move allowed the Ponzi scheme to circulate funds for longer periods of time while appeasing investors to a degree. Yavin commented:
OneCoin was known for its ruthless and over-the-top marketing tactics such as putting on extravagant productions where the charismatic face of OneCoin, Ignatova, and other promoters talked up the cryptocurrency to unwary victims. Just take as an example the dramatic, fire-filled “Coin Rush” spectacle at the SSE Arena in London where, in typical OneCoin fashion, Ignatova dubbed ( ) OneCoin the “Bitcoin killer” and anyone who spoke against it a “hater.”
In the aforementioned event, Ignatova stated OneCoin would get a new and improved blockchain and that the OneCoin supply would be doubled, thus doubling the holdings of those present. However, two weeks later, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin development space, Bjorn Bjercke, was reportedly approached with an offer to become OneCoin’s chief technical officer and develop an actual blockchain, which he refused ( ). Contradictions and empty promises kept piling up on OneCoin’s lap, and at this point, its so-called exchange had already been closed for a few months, since March 2016.
Following the many warnings and stories regarding the cult-like Ponzi scheme, many investors began to get nervous, especially as promises of a new public exchange were never delivered upon. Nevertheless, the show went on, right up until October 2017 when Ignatova disappeared and the OneCoin pyramid scheme began to crumble.
Cointelegraph spoke with Jen McAdam, a victim of OneCoin’s Ponzi scheme who founded a support group for those affected. She explained how OneCoin gradually revealed itself as a scam both through the actions of the company and the technological aspects of the OneCoin “blockchain.” McAdam and her friends and family invested and lost over 250,000 euros ($298,800), but according to her, only in January 2017 did she realize that its SQL server was not a blockchain and could not create crypto:
Ignatova’s brother, Ignatov, took the mantle and continued the OneCoin scam for almost two years until he was arrested on March 6, 2019 in Los Angeles. Despite being dismissed from one civil class-action lawsuit, Ignatov pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and fraud on Oct. 4, 2019 and is facing up to 90 years in prison in a criminal case filed by a New York district attorney ( ) following his arrest. However, the U.S. court has postponed the sentencing ( ) more than once following government requests, but it is now set to take place on Nov. 11.
While the investigation leading up to the aforementioned class-action lawsuit uncovered a sales revenue of around $4.4 billion, some sources who worked closely with OneCoin claim that the scheme could have stolen up to $19.4 billion. According to Digitpol, a private investigation agency, law enforcement officials in China have been able to recover ( ) around $267 million and have prosecuted 98 people in the process.
There was not a lack of warning from central banks and other government agencies ( ) ; however, people all over the world still fell for it. McAdam told Cointelegraph that OneCoin claimed to have over 3.5 million members, although the number does seem to be exaggerated. She also told Cointelegraph about the many thousands that have reached out to her support group for help:
Several people have been connected to OneCoin in one way or another, with some having been arrested for promoting or participating in the project while others are on the run. Many of the people behind the scheme have remained anonymous, and it’s also unclear if there is any form of organized criminal involvement. In the lawsuit filed by investors, several names were mentioned ( ) , including the company OneCoin Ltd, Ignatova, Ignatov, Sebastian Greenwood and Mark Scott.
Greenwood was previously involved in the defunct pyramid scheme Unaico and worked for OneCoin in various capacities. Many OneCoin figures had a questionable past, such as the ex-president of OneCoin, Nigel Allan, who prior to a falling out with Ignatova was implicated in similar pyramid schemes such as Crypto 888 and Brilliant Carbon.
On the other hand, Irina Andreeva Dilinska, David Pike and Nicole Huesmann have also been named as defendants in the class-action lawsuit, with some remaining unserved. Le Quoc-Hung, a key figure in the recruitment for OneCoin, has recently resurfaced and is using his OneCoin channels to promote yet another scam ( ) , although his whereabouts are unknown.
Several people and entities have also been accused of laundering money for OneCoin and its members, including Pike, who allegedly laundered roughly $400 million through "Fonero Funds," a private equity fund. Pike, the chief operating officer of Fonero Funds, has claimed that he did not know the funds came from the scam. Scott is also believed to have laundered OneCoin’s funds.
Many other key figures that were believed to have been involved, especially as promoters and recruiters, have been arrested outside of the U.S., and recently, two OneCoin promoters were convicted in Singapore ( ). The roots of the OneCoin Ponzi scheme stretch deep, so much so that even churches were found to have been involved ( ). Grant Blaisdell, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Coinfirm — a blockchain analytics and Anti-Money Laundering firm — told Cointelegraph:
While recovering funds lost to OneCoin, or any scam for that matter, is not easy, there are still a few things that can be done. According to McAdam, her OneCoin victim support groups have made progress in exposing the scam and raising awareness:
McAdam also told Cointelegraph that it’s possible that once the lawsuits are concluded and the people behind OneCoin are behind bars, “USA courts will focus on a global onecoin victim asset recovery fund and lawyers will then be interested to help the victims recover their money.” Blaisdell also stated that victims can turn to Coinfirm to receive help:
In the meantime, it’s possible that some may have resorted to more drastic measures, as two OneCoin promoters were recently found dead in Mexico ( ) , although it’s also possible that local cartels might have been involved in the crime.
With the inspiration behind OneCoin, Ignatova, still missing and her brother arrested, the scam seems to be dead and buried. However, while OneCoin’s website has been taken down ( ) , the movement doesn’t seem to be completely dead. In fact, following the arrest of Ignatov and other members of the community, OneCoin officials have denied reports that it is a Ponzi scheme and have even signed a petition to free Ignatov.
Now, with yield farming becoming popular through decentralized finance ( ) , this new sector is also attracting new scams. Another large scam that has been exposed, PlusToken ( ) , promised users a return on their deposits, similar to DeFi lending and interest protocols. In fact, scams are still on the rise ( ) and can impact the crypto industry as a whole. While it’s unlikely that scams of this sort will ever truly disappear, potential investors should always take the time to educate themselves on how to detect and avoid them ( ) , as McAdam told Cointelegraph:----




http://www.economicsofbitcoin.com/2013/01/market-forces-and-fractional-reserve.html

Ralph Musgrave made a blog post " Lawrence White Tries to Argue for Fractional Reserve Banking ( ) " where he criticises some of the arguments made by Lawrence White in testimony on his fractional-reserve banking ( ). I tend to agree with many of the things Ralph wrote, but here I'll concentrate one one aspect where I disagree.
The first one (which I cannot find explicitly in White's testimony), is that holding less than 100% reserves decreases storage costs. Even if the "excess" reserves were used in a different manner than loaned out, FRB would still have lower operating costs. Storage costs are a subset of what I call "maintenance costs of money substitutes". One might argue that if a withdrawal request arises in excess of reserves, the transaction costs of facilitating redemption (e.g. sale of assets) would be higher in an FRB. But the operational issues of redemption are not a feature specific to FRB. Even in a full reserve system, as long as branch operations are allowed, it is still possible that someone wants to withdraw more than the available reserves in that specific branch. The withdrawal would still have to be postponed and either the reserves transported from another branch, or some assets sold (the latter might be still chosen even in a full reserve banking if it has lower transaction costs, which is entirely possible).
Now, I have a minor addition here, it is hypothetically possible to create a bearer instrument with demurrage (e.g. stamps) even on a 100% reserve banking. Whether there is a practical merit in that I will leave open, but I'll ignore it for the time being, in order to explain the argument of White. So, let me reformulate White's argument: *In a metallic monetary system, as long as people prefer bank notes to coins, FRB will emerge.* This is a straightforward logical necessity. Irrespective of what people think about legitimacy of FRB, in this particular case it is an unavoidable consequence of consumer demand. Why might people prefer bank notes to coins? I'll address that right away.
Here it gets a bit tricky, because anti-FRB-ists, when criticising FRB, tend to "objectivise the boundaries of goods". They argue that an instrument issued by the bank is treated by the users of that good as a substitute because they think it's the same good (i.e. it is a claim, an ownership title). But this is a non-sequitur. The best refutation of this assumption are so called "complementary currencies", in particular those of type "mutual credit". Mutual credit are a form of circulating medium of exchange which is derived from a "normal" money (e.g. the USD or EUR), but they are not based on deposit banking. Some of the more popular examples are WIR ( ) and TEM ( ).
In other words, a subsitute medium of exchange (money substitute) does not need to be a claim. Mutual credit is not even convertible into the base money. This leaves the question open: why are then some goods accepted as a substitute medium of exchange? The Austrians know this, but magically, when talking about FRB, they forget about it. *They are accepted as substitutes because they decrease transaction costs.* Practically all of the anti-FRB Austrians realise this, but only when not talking about FRB: Rothbard, Hoppe, Salerno, de Soto.
So what are money substitutes? Money substitutes are *copies* of the monetary base. They are persistently causally related to the original (e.g. by a peg, by using the same name, etc.), and they act as substitutes from economic point of view. And, at the latest since Kinsella's Against Intellectual Property ( ) , the Austrians increasingly come to the realisation that copying is not per se a violation of property rights. Analogously, creating an instrument which is subsequently then accepted as a substitute by the market is not, per se, a violation of property rights either.
Now that we have clarified what are money substitutes, we can look at cross-subsidising. The instruments issued by the banks are copies. They have two important features that distinguish them from the originals:
Here the error of anti-FRBists becomes apparent. They do not realise that the instruments are goods separate from the original. They draw the boundaries of goods based on their own desires, not based on how these goods are treated by the market. The result of banking is a new good, that unifies lower transaction costs with credit expansion. Even if they don't like it, this is the economic fundament of the banks' activities.
Since this new good, this copy, satisfies both the demand for lower transaction costs and credit expansion, these two activities economically manifest themselves as one. The merging of these two activities by the bank is simply a response to this unified demand. As long as this new good, copy, satisfies both demands, the activities of the bank are economically inseparable. Therefore, there is no cross-subsidising, similarly as the manufacturing of tires is not cross-subsidising the manufacturing of chassis as long as people demand the whole car, even if some people have a fetish for the tires and want to ban car assembly.
Unlike the freebanking branch of the Austrian school, I actually agree with the gold standard branch that credit expansion [ *EDIT:* and I mean *any* credit expansion] leads to distortions, such as the business cycle. So I'm at odds with both of them, as I argue that credit expansion [ *EDIT:* I originally wrote FRB but that is inaccurate, it should be credit expansion] is economically detrimental, yet not a violation of property rights, but a consequence of market forces. I could just end here, leaving everyone baffled and annoyed. But this blog is called "Economics of Bitcoin". And here it comes in.
Now, putting it all together, *if the transaction costs of monetary base are sufficiently low, money substitutes do not emerge, and thus there is no credit expansion.* Bitcoin shows that such a system is empirically possible. It "fixes" credit expansion without "fixing" FRB. Is that a hack? No. Money substitutes are a hack, and credit expansion is a result of that. Bitcoin shows that a proper solution is possible.
The gold standard branch argues that according to Mises, any issue of fiduciary media is credit is disequilibrating, and if it is sufficiently extensive, results in a business cycle (I would put in particular Rothbard, Hoppe, de Soto and Block into this category). Some of them argue that in a fully free banking, the market forces will result in a nearly full reserve (Rothbard seems to take this approach). Some argue that freebanking will reach some sort of equilibrium state where the reserve ratio will be stable, and in this state the money supply will be less elastic and thus there won't be a cyclical behaviour (one example that comes to mind is Detlev Schlichter in his "Paper Money Collapse"). Some argue that in a free market, money and credit will be separated (I got this impression from Robert Murphy, for example).
The freebankers (represented in particular Selgin and White) argue that the issue of fiduciary media on a free market with commodity monetary base is not disequilibrating, as it is a reaction to bank customer demand, and thus the money supply adjustments are warranted.
I think that the freebankers' argument is invalid, and that the gold standardists are probably correct that any issue of fiduciary media is disequilibrating (while I also disagree with their prognoses mentioned above about "what would happen in a free market"). I want to write another blog post about this. I already wrote about it in comments on freebanking.org and uneasymoney.com, but neither Selgin nor Glasner seem to understand my argument so I want to put it together in a bit more elaborate manner.
Does "Transaction Costs" also include storage costs? While bitcoin transaction costs may be negligable, it's conceivable that users will entrust storage of their bitcoins to "banks" (e.g. to avoid the cost of security), thus opening the door to money substitution. Observe the popularity of online wallets.
The storage, I agree, is not costless. But Bitcoin is what I call "form-invariant", it can exist in practically any imaginable form natively, and there is no necessity for a deposit-banking-style service to provide the best offering. By the way, the argument that service providers might be able to provide something extra over native Bitcoin, that will allow them to practice credit expansion is not new, the first serious version of the argument I know of was presented by Eli Gothill: . Coincidentally, I'll probably meet Eli this weekend at the UNsystem Bitcoin Conference Preview, and I would like to discuss it with him.
First of all, not all online wallets are modeled on the deposit system. There are at least two that are native Bitcoin rather than deposits: strongcoin and blockchain.info wallet. They use client-side encryption, so the server can't spend the Bitcoins on its own, it only provides infrastructure for the act of managing the wallet and creating transactions. Second, there are ways of storing it which have not even been possible with previous systems, for example brainwallets (storing Bitcoins in your brain) and multi-key signatures (e.g. "bank" has one key, you have the other one, and only together you can transfer the Bitcons).
Some of the hypothetical features might not be present in a usable implementation at the moment, but I expect them to mature and provide a wide variety of options of storing Bitcoins, to serve the consumers in the most fitting way. While I can't completely exclude the possibility of a Bitcoin-substitute to be accepted as a medium of exchange (as it's an empirical issue), I think it is unlikely.
Just out of curiousity, is the FRB analysis I posted to reddit comments a couple of weeks ago basically the same thing that you're saying here, or do you think I'm using the wrong terms or mental models for any of it?
Jeff Tucker read my master's thesis and he appears to be very positive about Bitcoin. Stephan Kinsella is also positive, there's an interview with him in Bitcoin Magazine issue #5 from December 2012. Walter Block and Joseph Salerno on the other hand don't appear to know much about Bitcoin.
George Selgin is somewhere in the middle. He gets some of its aspects very well, but he made some critical remarks. Detlev Schichter is skeptical, but he understands that there is a lot of merit to Bitcoin.
My main impression is that the typical Austrian economist is stuck with gold and thinks that if something is to beat gold, it will take a long time, and by that time it will be obvious to anyone that the replacement took place. They don't see how you can predict the outcome of competition among media of exchange, other than to refer to the historical technological and regulatory factors. Therefore, I speculate, they don't see why they should spend time on learning about it.----




https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption

**The minimum is calculated from the total network hashrate, assuming the only machine used in the network is Bitmain’s Antminer S9 (drawing 1,500 watts each ( ) ). On February 13, 2019, the minimum benchmark was changed to Bitmain’s Antminer S15 (with a rolling average of 180 days), followed by Bitmain’s Antminer S17e per November 7, 2019 and Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro per  October 31, 2020.
Ever since its inception Bitcoin’s trust-minimizing consensus has been enabled by its proof-of-work algorithm. The machines performing the “work” are consuming huge amounts of energy while doing so. Moreover, the energy used is primarily sourced from fossil fuels. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was created to provide insight into these amounts, and raise awareness on the unsustainability of the proof-of-work algorithm.
New sets of transactions (blocks) are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain roughly every 10 minutes by so-called miners. While working on the blockchain these miners aren’t required to trust each other. The only thing miners have to trust is the code that runs Bitcoin. The code includes several rules to validate new transactions. For example, a transaction can only be valid if the sender actually owns the sent amount. Every miner individually confirms whether transactions adhere to these rules, eliminating the need to trust other miners.
The trick is to get all miners to agree on the same history of transactions. Every miner in the network is constantly tasked with preparing the next batch of transactions for the blockchain. Only one of these blocks will be randomly selected to become the latest block on the chain. Random selection in a distributed network isn’t easy ( ) , so this is where proof-of-work comes in. In proof-of-work, the next block comes from the first miner that produces a valid one. This is easier said than done, as the Bitcoin protocol makes it very difficult for miners to do so. In fact, the difficulty is regularly adjusted by the protocol to ensure that all miners in the network will only produce one valid block every 10 minutes on average. Once one of the miners finally manages to produce a valid block, it will inform the rest of the network. Other miners will accept this block once they confirm it adheres to all rules, and then discard whatever block they had been working on themselves. The lucky miner gets rewarded with a fixed amount of coins, along with the transaction fees belonging to the processed transactions in the new block. The cycle then starts again.
The process of producing a valid block is largely based on trial and error, where miners are making numerous attempts every second trying to find the right value for a block component called the “ nonce ( ) “, and hoping the resulting completed block will match the requirements (as there is no way to predict the outcome). For this reason, mining is sometimes compared to a lottery where you can pick your own numbers. The number of attempts (hashes) per second is given by your mining equipment’s hashrate. This will typically be expressed in Gigahash per second (1 billion hashes per second).
The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of the currency reached new highs. The entire Bitcoin network now consumes more energy than a number of countries. If Bitcoin was a country, it would rank as shown below.
Bitcoin’s biggest problem is perhaps not even its massive energy consumption, but the fact most mining facilties in Bitcoin’s network are located in regions (primarily in China) that rely heavily on coal-based power (either directly or for the purpose of load balancing). To put it simply: “ coal is fueling Bitcoin ( ) ” (Stoll, 2019).
Determining the exact carbon impact of the Bitcoin network has been a challenge for years. Not only does one need to know the power requirement of the Bitcoin network, but one also need to know where this power is coming from. The location of miners is a key ingredient to know how dirty or how clean the power is that they are using.
Just like it’s not easy to find out what machines are active in the Bitcoin network, determining location isn’t an easy feat either. Initially the only information available to this end was the common belief that the majority of miners were located in China. Since we know the average emission factor of the Chinese grid (around 700 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour), this can be used for a very rough approximation of the carbon intensity of the power used for Bitcoin mining. Assuming that 70% of Bitcoin mining is taking place in China, and that 30% of mining is completely clean, this yields a weighted average carbon intensity of 490 This number can subsequently be applied to a power consumption estimate of the Bitcoin network to determine its carbon footprint.
Later on, more granular information became available in the Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study ( ) by Garrick Hileman and Michel Rauchs from 2017. In this study, they identified facilities representing roughly half of the entire Bitcoin hash rate, with a total (lower bound) consumption of 232 megawatts. Chinese mining facilities were responsible for about half of this, with a lower bound consumption of 111 megawatts. This information can be used to get a more accurate idea of the carbon emission factor in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour that applies to the electricity used for mining.
The table below features a breakdown of the energy consumption of the mining facilities surveyed by Hileman and Rauchs. By applying the emission factors of the respective country’s grid, we find that the Bitcoin network had a weighted average carbon intensity of 475 gCO2eq per kWh consumed. (This number is currently applied to determine the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network based on the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.)
One can argue that specific locations in the listed countries may offer less carbon intense power. In 2018 Bitcoin company Coinshares suggested that the majority of Chinese mining facilities were located in Sichuan province, using cheap hydropower for mining Bitcoin. Subsequent studies have, however, never been able to support this claim found the opposite. Confronted with this evidence, the lead author of the Coinshares paper had to admit “mistakes” were made ( ).
The main challenge here is that the production of hydropower (or renewable energy in general) is far from constant ( ). In Sichuan specifically the average power generation capacity during the wet season is three times that of the dry season. Because of these fluctuations in hydroelectricity generation, Bitcoin miners can only make use of cheap hydropower for a limited amount of time.
In a study titled “ The Carbon Footprint of Bitcoin ( ) ” (Stoll et al. 2019) properly account for these regional differences (while also introducing a new method to localize miners based on IP-addresses), but still find a weighted average carbon intensity of 480-500 gCO2eq per kWh for the entire Bitcoin network (in line with previous and more rough estimations).
Using a similar approach, Cambridge in 2020 provided a more detailed insight into the localization of Bitcoin miners over time ( ). Charting this data, and adding colors based on the carbon intensity of the respective power grids, we can reveal significant mining activity in highly polluting regions of the world during the Chinese dry season (as shown below). On an annual basis, the average contribution of renewable energy sources therefore remains low. When Cambridge subsequently surveyed miners (also in 2020), respondents indicated only 39% ( ) of their total energy consumption actually came from renewables. Cambridge noted that this primarily concerned hydroelectric power, which was mainly sourced from China’s Sichuan province during the summer (rain season) months. An update on the Cambridge mining map in 2021 showed that the share of the network in these areas was already declining prior to the Chinese ban on cryptocurrency mining ( ).
It is important to realize that, while renewables are an intermittent source of energy, Bitcoin miners have a constant energy requirement. A Bitcoin ASIC miner will, once turned on, not be switched off until it either breaks down or becomes unable to mine Bitcoin at a profit. Because of this, Bitcoin miners increase the baseload demand on a grid. They don’t just consume energy when there is an excess of renewables, but still require power during production shortages. In the latter case Bitcoin miners have historically ended up using fossil fuel based power (which is generally a more steady source of energy).
Further substantiation on why Bitcoin and renewable energy make for the worst match can be found in the peer-reviewed academic article “ Renewable Energy Will Not Solve Bitcoin’s Sustainability Problem ( ) ” featured on Joule. With climate change pushing the volatility of hydropower production in places like Sichuan, this is unlikely to get any better in the future.
To put the energy consumed by the Bitcoin network into perspective we can compare it to another payment system like VISA for example. According to VISA, the company consumed a total amount of 740,000 Gigajoules ( ) of energy (from various sources) globally for all its operations. This means that VISA has an energy need equal to that of around 19,304 U.S. households. We also know VISA processed 138.3 billion transactions in 2019 ( ). With the help of these numbers, it is possible to compare both networks and show that Bitcoin is extremely more energy intensive per transaction than VISA. The difference in carbon intensity per transaction is even greater (see footprints ( ) ), as the energy used by VISA is relatively “greener” than the energy used by the Bitcoin mining network. The carbon footprint per VISA transaction is only 0.45 grams CO2eq.
Of course, VISA isn’t perfectly representative for the global financial system. But even a comparison with the average non-cash transaction in the regular financial system still reveals that an average Bitcoin transaction requires several thousands of times more energy ( ).
One key reason why the CO2 emissions per Bitcoin transaction can be so extreme is that the underlying blockchain isn’t just built on an energy-demanding algorithm, but it’s also extremely limited in terms of transaction processing capacity. A block for Bitcoin’s blockchain can contain 1 megabyte of data. As a new block will be generated only once every 10 minutes on average, this data limit prevents the network from handling more than 7 transactions per second. In the most optimistic scenario Bitcoin could therefore theoretically handle around 220 million transactions annually. Meanwhile, the global financial system is handling more than 700 billion digital payments ( ) per year (and a payment provider like VISA can handle over 65,000 per second if needed ( ) ). Bitcoin’s maximum transaction capacity represents only 0.03% of this (rapidly growing) number. This is less than the total number of electronic payments processed in a country like Hungary (more than 300 million per year ( ) ), not even considering that cash still makes up for two thirds ( ) of all payment transactions here. With such an incredibly low limit, Bitcoin is simply incapable of achieving any form of mainstream adoption as a global currency payment system. Unlike the network’s transaction limit, the energy consumption of the network isn’t capped. The price of Bitcoin is the main driver ( ) of the network’s environmental impact, and there’s no limit to how high this can go. Because of this, the Bitcoin network can consume several times as much electrical energy as the entire country of Hungary (which consumes 43 TWh annually).
Unfortunately for Bitcoin, there’s no real solution for this scalability problem either. Proponents of the digital currency argue that so-called second layer solutions like the Lightning Network will help scaling Bitcoin, while dismissing that it is practically impossible to make such a solution work on a substantial scale. In order to move any amount of funds into the Lightning Network in the first place, a funding transaction on the main network is still required. It would take the Bitcoin network 35 years to process a single funding transaction for all 7.7 billion people (2021) on this planet, ignoring any other possible use of the main network and further population growth in the meanwhile. The only practical solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem has, so far, been to make use of trusted third parties, as these can process transactions internally without the need to actually use the Bitcoin blockchain. The obvious problem with this is that it merely reinvents the system we already have in place.
Because of the aforementioned scalability issues, it’s often argued that Bitcoin is more like “digital gold” than a payment system. Hence we can also compare Bitcoin mining to gold mining instead. Every year, around 3,531 tonnes ( ) of gold are mined, with a total related emissions amounting to 81 million metric tonnes of CO2 ( ). When comparing this to the carbon intensity of mining Bitcoins, we can observe that the latter exceeds that of mining real gold (see below). Note that this includes mined fees, which has no comparison in mining for real gold (as we’d have to put previously mined gold back into the ground). Likewise, the comparison is also flawed because we can stop mining for real gold, whereas Bitcoin would simply stop existing without active mining.
Proof-of-work was the first consensus algorithm that managed to prove itself, but it isn’t the only consensus algorithm. More energy efficient algorithms, like proof-of-stake, have been in development over recent years. In proof-of-stake coin owners create blocks rather than miners, thus not requiring power hungry machines that produce as many hashes per second as possible. Because of this, the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is negligible compared to proof-of-work. Bitcoin could potentially switch to such an consensus algorithm, which would significantly improve environmental sustainability. It is estimated that a switch to proof-of-stake could save 99.95% ( ) of the energy currently required to run a proof-of-work based system.
Even though the total network hashrate can easily be calculated, it is impossible to tell what this means in terms of energy consumption as there is no central register with all active machines (and their exact power consumption). In the past, energy consumption estimates typically included an assumption on what machines were still active and how they were distributed, in order to arrive at a certain number of Watts consumed per  A detailed examination of a real-world Bitcoin mine ( ) shows why such an approach will certainly lead to underestimating the network’s energy consumption, because it disregards relevant factors like machine-reliability, climate and cooling costs. This arbitrary approach has therefore led to a wide set of energy consumption estimates that strongly deviate from one another, sometimes with a disregard to the economic consequences of the chosen parameters. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index therefore proposes to turn the problem around, and approach energy consumption from an economic perspective.
The index is built on the premise that miner income and costs are related. Since electricity costs are a major component of the ongoing costs, it follows that the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network must be related to miner income as well. To put it simply, the higher mining revenues, the more energy-hungry machines can be supported. How the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index uses miner income to arrive at an energy consumption estimate is explained in detail here ( ) (also in peer-reviewed academic literature here ( ) ), and summarized in the following infographic:
Note that one may reach different conclusions on applying different assumptions (a calculator that allows for testing different assumptions has been made available here ( ) ). The chosen assumptions have been chosen in such a way that they can be considered to be both intuitive and conservative, based on information of actual mining operations. In the end, the goal of the Index is not to produce a perfect estimate, but to produce an economically credible day-to-day estimate that is more accurate and robust than an estimate based on the efficiency of a selection of mining machines.----

The block chain is a *public record of Bitcoin transactions* in chronological order. The block chain is shared between all Bitcoin users. It is used to verify the permanence of Bitcoin transactions and to prevent double spending ( #double-spend ).
A block is a *record in the block chain that contains and confirms many waiting transactions*. Roughly every 10 minutes, on average, a new block including transactions is appended to the block chain ( #block-chain ) through mining ( #mining ).
Confirmation means that a transaction has been *processed by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed*. Transactions receive a confirmation when they are included in a block ( ) and for each subsequent block. Even a single confirmation can be considered secure for low value transactions, although for larger amounts like $1000 USD, it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more. Each confirmation exponentially decreases the risk of a reversed transaction.
Cryptography is the branch of mathematics that lets us create *mathematical proofs that provide high levels of security*. Online commerce and banking already uses cryptography. In the case of Bitcoin, cryptography is used to make it impossible for anybody to spend funds from another user's wallet or to corrupt the block chain ( #block-chain ). It can also be used to encrypt a wallet, so that it cannot be used without a password.
If a malicious user tries to *spend their bitcoins to two different recipients at the same time* , this is double spending. Bitcoin mining ( #mining ) and the block chain ( #block-chain ) are there to create a consensus on the network about which of the two transactions will confirm and be considered valid.
The hash rate is the *measuring unit of the processing power of the Bitcoin network*. The Bitcoin network must make intensive mathematical operations for security purposes. When the network reached a hash rate of 10 it meant it could make 10 trillion calculations per second.
Bitcoin mining is the process of *making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions* and increase security. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm, along with newly created bitcoins. Mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done. Not all Bitcoin users do Bitcoin mining, and it is not an easy way to make money.
A private key is a *secret piece of data that proves your right to spend bitcoins from a specific wallet* through a cryptographic signature ( #signature ). Your private key(s) are stored in your computer if you use a software wallet; they are stored on some remote servers if you use a web wallet. Private keys must never be revealed as they allow you to spend bitcoins for their respective Bitcoin wallet.
A cryptographic ( #cryptography ) signature is *a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership*. In the case of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet ( #wallet ) and its private key(s) ( #private-key ) are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the bitcoins being spent. However, there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins.
A Bitcoin wallet is loosely *the equivalent of a physical wallet on the Bitcoin network*. The wallet actually contains your private key(s) ( #private-key ) which allow you to spend the bitcoins allocated to it in the block chain ( #block-chain ). Each Bitcoin wallet can show you the total balance of all bitcoins it controls and lets you pay a specific amount to a specific person, just like a real wallet. This is different to credit cards where you are charged by the merchant.----

Your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account. Just like your Reddit account has a username (public) and password (private), so does your Ethereum account–the difference being that you are the custodian of your Ethereum keys, while Reddit holds your login information for their site. For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a username (public) and password (private) and password for that password (private + more secure). See also ‘keystore file’.
Used to send and receive transactions on a blockchain network. An address is an alphanumeric character string, which can also be represented as a scannable QR code. In Ethereum, the address begins with 0x. For example: 0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee
A token distribution method used to send cryptocurrency or tokens to wallet addresses. Sometimes airdrops are used for marketing purposes in exchange for simple tasks like reshares, referrals, or app downloads.
ASICs are silicon chips designed to do a specific task. In ASIC use for mining cryptocurrencies, the ASIC will perform a calculation to find values that provide a desired solution when placed into a hashing algorithm.
Under the Proof of Stake mechanism (on the Beacon Chain), every validator other than the one proposing a new block will provide an attestation, or vote, in favor of a block with which it agrees, hereby forming consensus and confirming the block and the transactions it contains. See also ‘Proof of Stake’.
The Beacon Chain (always capitalized) is one element in the infrastructure being built to scale Ethereum, and is the foundation for a transition from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). For more information, see this guide ( ).
The first cryptocurrency based on a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakomoto — a pseudonym for an individual whose real identity is unknown — and the concept of cryptocurrency was outlined in a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” ( ) Use “Bitcoin” for the “bitcoin” for the cryptocurrency. The plural of bitcoin is just bitcoin; the abbreviation is BTC, with a space: I have 250 BTC.
Think of a blockchain as consisting of a ledger that is being constantly updated, and those changes synced between any number of different nodes (indeed, “distributed ledger technology” is another phrase used to describe it).
After a certain number of transactions have been added to the ledger and consensus has been reached among the nodes that the transactions are valid, then they are cryptographically locked into a “block” and officially recorded. This “block” forms the basis for the next one; in this way, they are all linked together in a chain, hence– *block* chain.
The reward given to a miner after it has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees. The composition depends on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 12.5 bitcoins per block.
When we talk about ‘block time’, we’re referring to how long it takes for a block of transactions (see ‘block’) to be confirmed by the network, either by miners under PoW or by validators under PoS. See also ‘Proof of Work’, ‘Proof of Stake’.
A digital ledger comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. Each block is ‘chained’ to the next block using a cryptographic signature. Ethereum is a public blockchain, open to the world; its digital ledger is distributed, or synced, between many nodes; these nodes arrive at consensus regarding whether a transaction is valid before encrypting a number of transactions into a block. For more on blockchain technology, see here ( ). See also ‘block’.
A blockchain account generated from a seed phrase or password or passphrase of your choosing. Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, or randomness, and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure; b rain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers. For this reason, b rain wallet are insecure and should not be used. See also ‘Seed phrase Secret Recovery Phrase’.
Ostensibly coined (see what we did there) by Gitcoin’s Kevin Owocki. It reflects the Ethereum-focused mindset of not just investing in a cryptocurrency as a store of value, but rather investing in it as an ecosystem and a platform for public goods and software; it complements, in this sense, the now- infamous HODL ( ).
Bytecode is a “low-level” computer language, that is, meant to be processed by a computer, rather than a “high-level”, more human-readable, language. In Ethereum, higher-level Solidity is compiled into Ethereum bytecode, which is read by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
An Ethereum client is software that accesses the Ethereum blockchain via a local computer and helps to process transactions. A client usually includes a cryptocurrency software wallet. See an up-to-date list of clients here ( ).
A confirmation happens when the network has verified the blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.
The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. Dominant consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of “crypto” tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as key pairs) that enable them, and enable them to be secure. Of course, “cryptocurrency” often gets shortened to simply “crypto”, so this emerging field is full of instances where something “crypto” is being added to or shortened.
Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank, and are kept track of through distributed ledger technology.
A method for secure communication using code. Symmetric-key cryptography is used by various blockchain networks for transfer of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain addresses generated for wallets are paired with private keys that allow transfer of cryptocurrency. Paired public and private keys allow funds to be unlocked.
Alternatively, the first known example of a DAO is referred to as The DAO. The DAO served as a form of investor-directed venture capital fund, which sought to provide enterprises with new decentralized business models. Ethereum-based, The DAO’s code was open source. The organization set the record for the most crowdfunded project in 2016. Those funds were partially stolen by hackers. The hack caused an Ethereum hard-fork which lead to the creation of Ethereum Classic.
An open source, software application with backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized server. You may see alternate spellings: dApps, DApps, Dapps, and Đapps.
A decentralized exchange is a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies based on functionality programmed on the blockchain (i.e., in smart contracts). The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. There are important technical and regulatory differences between the two which are constantly evolving.
The concept outlining how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network during Proof of Work mining. In the Bitcoin network, the difficulty of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten minutes.
The difficulty bomb, along with the Beacon Chain and others, is an element of Ethereum’s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As the name indicates, the difficulty bomb is a mechanism that will increase the block verification difficulty, making it more expensive and difficult–eventually, prohibitively so–to mine a new block. The intention is to force the shift to PoS consensus. See also ‘Proof of Stake’.
A type of database which spreads across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Records are stored sequentially in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned” to control who can view it.
An event during which someone on the Bitcoin network tries to send a specific bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at once. However, as each bitcoin transaction is confirmed, double spending becomes almost impossible. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has, the decreased likelihood of double spending successfully.
EIPs describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. They are, precisely, proposals for modifications to the network and the way it functions; the official repository is here ( ).
As discussed elsewhere, public and private crypographic key pairs are one of the technologies that underpins cryptocurrencies and “crypto” tech in general. In MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption.
For example, if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new shortened encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption. Usually encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe.
There are many types of encryption, but for our purposes, it is a process that combines the text to be encrypted (plaintext) with a shorter string of data referred to as “a key” in order to produce an output (ciphertext). This output can be “decrypted” back into the original plaintext by someone else who has the key.
An epoch, in general, is a measure of time, or of blockchain progression, on a given blockchain. For the Ethereum Beacon Chain, an epoch consists of 32 slots, each lasting 12 seconds, for a total of 6.4 minutes per epoch. There is additional functionality built upon the epoch measure in the Beacon Chain to help ensure security and proper operation of the Chain.
ERC is the abbreviation for Ethereum Request for Comment ( ) and is followed by the assignment number of the standard. ERC-20 ( ) is a technical standard for smart contracts which is used to issue the majority of tokens (in particular, cryptocurrency tokens) extant on Ethereum. This list of rules states the requirements that a token must fulfill to be compliant and function within the Ethereum network.
Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain network. Ether—also referred to as ETH (pronounced with a long “e”, like “teeth” without the “t”)—functions as a fuel of the Ethereum ecosystem by acting as a medium of incentive and form of payment for network participants to execute essential operations. The cryptocurrency of Ethereum has a lowercase e. The plural of ether is just ether; its abbreviation is ETH, with a space: I have 10 ETH.
Ethereum Request for Comment, or ERC, is a bit of a misnomer, as it is used to refer to suggestions for modifications that have already made it through the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) process and have been made standard on Ethereum. An ERC is, essentially, a set of standards for a given operation or topic on the Ethereum network. The authoritative list can be found here ( ).
The EVM is a virtual machine ( ) that operates on the Ethereum network. It is Turing complete and allows anyone, anywhere to execute arbitrary EVM bytecode. All Ethereum nodes run on the EVM. It is home for smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain.
A faucet is an application, sometimes a very simple website, other times more complex, that dispenses cryptocurrency for use on test networks only. These faucets are used by developers to test out dapps or smart contracts before deploying them on Ethereum Mainnet, or users who want to practice an action on the blockchain with no risk. Tokens dispensed by a test faucet stay on the test networks and cannot be exchanged for mainnet equivalents.
A transaction is considered “final” once it can no longer be changed. In a sense, this happens once there are sufficient confirmations of the transaction, but for all intents and purposes, a transaction is final once the block that contains it is mined or validated. Keep in mind that this reflects a fundamental rule of blockchains: unlike traditional financial systems where charges can be “reversed”, there is no “undoing” a transaction on the blockchain. Once finality is reached, the transaction is immutable.
A fork creates an alternative version of a blockchain, and are often enacted intentionally to apply upgrades to a network. Soft Forks render two chains with some compatibility, while Hard Forks create a new version of the chain that must be adopted to continue participation. In the instance of a contentious Hard Fork, this can create two versions of a blockchain network. See also “hard fork”.
A measure of the computational steps required for a transaction on the Ethereum network. This then equates to a fee for network users paid in small units of ETH specified as Gwei. See also “ether (denominations)”. For more on gas, see MetaMask’s user guide here ( ).
The gas limit is the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for any given transaction to go through the Ethereum network. Another way of looking at it is as a “rough estimate” of how much computing power your transaction will take.
The gas price is what it sounds like: the cost the network is paid for the computational work being performed in a given transaction. It is paid in units of ETH called Gwei. Depending on network congestion, the gas price may vary significantly.
Many cryptocurrencies have a finite supply, which makes them a scarce digital commodity. For example, the total amount of Bitcoin that will ever be issued is 21 million. The number of bitcoins generated per block is decreased 50% every four years. This is called “halving.” The final halving will take place in the year 2140.
A hard fork occurs when there is a change in the blockchain that is not backward compatible (not compatible with older versions), thus requiring all participants to upgrade to the new version in order to be able to continue participating on the network. See also “fork”.
A programmatic function that takes an input, and then outputs an alphanumeric string known as the “hash value” or “digital fingerprint.” Each block in the blockchain contains the hash value that validated the transaction before it followed by its own hash value. Hashes confirm transactions on the blockchain.
Hierarchical Deterministic wallets were first created for Bitcoin, and enable the creation of a very large number of accounts based on an initial seed phrase. This technology was later adopted in Ethereum wallets; when restoring a MetaMask wallet from the Secret Recovery Phrase, for example, if you “create” accounts, they will be the same accounts as previously created from that same phrase; they are derived from it.
Hexadecimal is a base 16, rather than base 10, counting system. Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and letters A B C D E F.
A wallet that is directly connected to the internet at all times, for example one that is held on a centralized exchange. Hot wallets are considered to have lower security than cold storage systems or hardware wallets.
Hyperledger ( ) is an ecosystem of open-system tools, libraries, and products designed to enable and support enterprise-grade blockchain technology. In general, the products focus on creating solutions for permissioned blockchains–that is, non-public blockchains, with alternative consensus mechanisms other than Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
That said, there are use cases where such institutions would want to integrate with public blockchains, and for that reason Hyperledger Besu ( ) and Hyperledger Burrow ( ) are actively developed projects, the former being a Java-based Ethereum client, the latter being a smart contract platform which supports EVM bytecode.
The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address. It is an easy way to see if your address is correct. More specifically, you can choose between jazzicons ( ) (created by the MetaMask team!) or blockies ( ).
The inability to be altered or changed. This is a key element of blockchain networks: once written onto a blockchain ledger, data cannot be altered. This immutability provides the basis for commerce and trade to take place on blockchain networks.
Part of ConsenSys, Infura ( ) offers backend access to the Ethereum network over established HTTP and WebSockets technology. This enables developers of dapps and websites seeking to interact with the Ethereum blockchain to do so, and at scale.
An Initial Coin Offering (also called ICO) occurs when a new cryptocurrency sells advance tokens in exchange for upfront capital. These have been a vehicle for fraud and scams, and as such are subject to ever-evolving regulation and legislation.
An internal transaction on the Ethereum network is one that occurs between smart contracts, rather than between addresses. Notably, they are not included on the blockchain, and therefore do not incur gas fees, but they are often crucial to carrying out the action in question, and can be viewed on Etherscan.
A decentralized file storage and referencing system for the Ethereum blockchain. IFPS ( ) is an open source protocol that enables storing and sharing hypermedia (text, audio, visual) in a distributed manner without relying on a single point of failure. This distributed file system enables applications to run faster, safer and more transparently.
A process in which a business must verify the identity and background information (address, financials, etc) of their customers. For example, current regulations and laws require banks and other financial institutions to keep and report customers’ personal information and transactions.
A client that downloads only a small part of the blockchain, allowing users of low-power or low-storage hardware like smartphones and laptops to maintain almost the same guarantee of security by sometimes selectively downloading small parts of the state.
A government system where votes can be delegated or proxied to other individuals such as friends, politicians, or subject matter experts. For example, in a liquid democracy, Bernadette could give Ahmad her vote and Ahmad would then vote for both himself and Bernadette. A liquid democracy has been explored as a governance mechanism for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations where every participant is able to vote or delegate their vote to another individual.
The primary network where actual transactions take place on a specific distributed ledger. For example, The Ethereum mainnet is the public blockchain where network validation and transactions take place.
Short for Market Capitalization, this term refers to the total value held in a particular industry, market, company, or asset. For a publicly traded company, the market cap is the total dollar market value of a company’s outstanding shares. For Bitcoin or Ethereum, the total market cap is a reflection of the current existing supply times the market price.
Often referred to simply as a “Merkle trie” (pronounced “tree”), a Merkle Patricia trie is a data structure in which a single hash code function (a type of cryptographic code) splits into smaller branches. In a similar way to a family tree, where a parent branch splits into child branches, which are then extrapolated into grandchild branches, a Merkle Patricia trie keeps a record of the filiation and history of each element. This type of data structure enables for faster verification on a blockchain network.
MetaMask ( ) , either in its mobile app form on iOS and Android, or in its browser extension form, is a tool to access and interact with blockchains and the decentralized web. Its functions include that of a wallet, a dapp permissions manager, and token swap platform.
The process by which blocks or transactions are verified and added to a blockchain using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. In order to verify a block a miner must use a computer to solve a cryptographic problem. Once the computer has solved the problem, the block is considered “mined” or verified. In the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains, the first computer to mine or verify the block receives bitcoin or ether as a reward.
A crypto-asset wallet that requires multiple keys to access. Typically, a specified number of individuals are required to approve or “sign” a transaction before they are able to access the wallet. This is different from most wallets which only require one signature to approve a transaction.
Any computer connected to the blockchain network is referred to as a node. A full node is a computer that can fully validate transactions and download the entire data of a specific blockchain. In contrast, a “lightweight” or “light” node does not download all pieces of a blockchain’s data and uses a different validation process.
When discussing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), “fungibility” refers to an object’s ability to be exchanged for another. For example, an individual dollar is considered fungible as we can trade dollars with one another. Artwork is usually deemed non-fungible as paintings, sculptures, or masterpieces are likely to be unequal in quality or value. A non-fungible token is a type of token that is a unique digital asset and has no equal token. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like ether that are fungible in nature.
The word ‘nonce’ has a few different meanings, and in different contexts, it ends up getting used a lot of different ways. Originally formed from a contraction of a phrase meaning “not more than once”, on the Ethereum mainnet, “nonce” refers to a unique transaction identification number that increases in value with each successive transaction in order to ensure various safety features (such as preventing a double-spend). Note that due to its broader use in cryptography, you may encounter ‘nonce’ being used differently on other sidechains or decentralized projects.
Under the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, miners received rewards for being the first to mine a new block. However, at times a block would be mined just after, and in competition with, the last block; this block, known as an ommer and previously as an uncle, could get rolled into subsequent blocks and the miner of the original ommer would get a partial block reward. All of this functionality is deprecated ( ) as of the Beacon Chain.
Typically, an oracle is any entity or person that is relied on to report the outcome of an event. In a blockchain network an oracle (human or machine) helps communicate data to a smart contract which can then be used to verify an event or specific outcome.
P2P refers to interactions that happen between two parties, usually two separate individuals. A P2P network can be any number of individuals. In regards to a blockchain network, individuals are able to transact or interact with each other without relying on an intermediary or single point of failure.
Parity Technologies ( ) is the name of a blockchain technology company that is developing a number of significant projects in the Ethereum space; however, one of its first projects was an Ethereum client, now known as Parity Ethereum; often this client is simply referred to as ‘Parity’. See also ‘client’.
A blockchain network in which access to ledger or network requires permission from an individual or group of individuals, as opposed to a public blockchain. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. Consensus on a permissioned ledger is conducted by the trusted actors, such as government departments, banks, or other known entities. Permissioned blockchains or ledgers contain highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is much easier to maintain and considerably faster than a public blockchain. For example, Quorum or Hyperledger Besu are permissioned ledgers that can be more easily set up for large enterprises. In contrast, the public Ethereum blockchain is a permissionless ledger which anyone can access.
Plasma is a term that is used to refer to one of the scaling solutions being deployed to create Layer 2 of the Ethereum network. A Plasma network functions similarly to an Optimistic rollup, inasmuch as it relies on Layer 1 Ethereum mainnet to maintain the record of transactions, and as the source for arbitration or fraud resolution. However, a Plasma network differs in other important technical ways from rollups, and is currently limited to simple operations, such as swaps and token transfers.
Acronyms standing for Proof of X consensus mechanisms: Assignment, Stake, Work. The “o” is lowercase since you wouldn’t capitalize “of” when writing out the phrase. See also ‘consensus’, ‘Proof of Authority’, ‘Proof of Stake’, ‘Proof of Work’.
A hybrid consensus model that utilizes a combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) consensus. Using this Hybrid consensus mechanism, blocks are validated from not only miners, but also voters (stakeholders) to form a balanced network governance.
A blockchain or distributed ledger that has a closed network where participants are controlled by a single entity. A private blockchain requires a verification process for new participants. A private blockchain may also limit which individuals are able to participate in consensus of the blockchain network. See also ‘permissioned ledger’.
A currency or token issued by a private individual or firm. Typically, the token or currency is limited to use within the network of that particular firm or individual. This is not to be confused with a “privacy cryptocurrency” which are cryptocurrency with specific privacy features, such as hidden user identities.
A private key is an alphanumeric string of data that, in MetaMask, corresponds to a single specific account in a wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password that enables an individual to access their crypto account. *Never reveal your private key to anyone, as whoever controls the private key controls the account funds. If you lose your private key, then you lose access to that account.*
A consensus mechanism in which an individual or “validator” validates transactions or blocks. Validators “stake” their cryptocurrency, such as ether, on whichever transactions they choose to validate. If the individual validates a block (group of transactions) correctly then the individual receives a reward. Typically, if a validator verifies an incorrect transaction then they lose the cryptocurrency that they staked. PoS requires a negligible amount of computing power compared to Proof of Work consensus.
A consensus mechanism in which each block is ‘mined’ by a group of individuals or nodes on the network. Hashing a block, which is in itself an easy computational process, under PoW requires each miner to solve for a set, difficult variable. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block. For each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency. PoW is singificantly more energy-intensive than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake.
In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key. You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key. The public key, therefore, is obtained and used by anyone to encrypt messages before they are sent to a known recipient with a matching private key for decryption. By pairing a public key with a private key, transactions not dependent on trusting involved parties or intermediaries. The public key encrypts a message into an unreadable format and the corresponding private key makes it readable again for the intended party, and the intended party only.
Any party or entity which hosts an off-chain orderbook. Relayers help traders discover counter-parties and cryptographically move orders between them. 0x ( ) is an example of a popular Ethereum relayer protocol.
Rollups (pronounced “roll ups”) are one element in the set of tools and infrastructure being built as Layer 2, the scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They consist, in general, of solutions in which the transaction data is still kept on Layer 1, the original Ethereum network, while transaction computation occurs on a side network, freeing up computational power on Layer. There are different ways of approaching this problem from a technical point of view, namely Zero Knowledge, or ZK, rollups, and Optimistic rollups. See the entries on both of these types of rollup for more, and more in-depth discussion here ( ).
Similar to the traditional financial scam of a pyramid scheme, a ‘rug pull’ is a cryptocurrency or crypto-token based scam in which the creators of the token create hype, through injecting liquidity into their token, airdropping, and other schemes, and once investors pile in and boost the price of the token up to a certain point, the creators liquidate their share of the tokens, leaving their investors with next to nothing.
A pseudonymous individual or entity who created the Bitcoin protocol, solving the digital currency issue of the “double spend.” Nakamoto first published their white paper ( ) describing the project in 2008 and the first Bitcoin software was released one year later.
A change in size or scale to handle a network’s demands. This word is used to refer to a blockchain project’s ability to handle network traffic, future growth, and capacity in its intended application.
The seed phrase, mnemonic, or Secret Recovery Phrase is a crucial part of public blockchain technology, originally created for Bitcoin ( ) , and goes by many names. However, they all refer to a set of ordered words which correspond to determined values. These values never change, and therefore the same string of words in the same order will always produce the same number–this is the underlying functionality that allows seed phrases to back up wallets. The Secret Recovery Phrase is exactly what it sounds like: something that is secret, and should be known only to the owner of the account. If the seed phrase is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the account; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc.
Sharding refers to splitting the entire network into multiple portions called “shards.” Each shard would contain its own independent state, meaning a unique set of account balances and smart contracts. Usually, shards must be tightly coupled and side-chains must be loosely coupled.
A sidechain is what it sounds like — it is a separate blockchain that is Ethereum-compatible. While a sidechain is a sort of scaling tool, as a class they aren’t part of Layer 2; they simply represent a way in which developers can build and enable cheaper transactions for the user (on the sidechain, in sidechain-native tokens or currencies) while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum network. This often requires routing tokens through a special portal or bridge, as sending tokens from a sidechain to Ethereum mainnet or vice versa would result in token loss.
Smart contracts are programs whose terms are recorded in computer code. While they often contain agreements or sets of actions between parties that emulate a traditional legal contract, they are not, in and of themselves, legal documents. Smart contracts are automated actions that can be coded and executed once a set of conditions is met, and are the dominant form of programming on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
A change to the software protocol where only previously valid are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. However, this can result in a potential divide in the blockchain, as the old software generates blocks that read as invalid according to the new rules.
Any cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, like fiat currency or gold. It theoretically remains stable in price as it is measured against a known amount of an asset less subject to fluctuation. Always spelled as one word.
In the Ethereum context, ‘staking’ of tokens or currency carries the traditional meaning of ‘setting aside currency for a determined purpose’; however, ‘staking’ can happen in a variety of venues with different effects. For example, on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), there is no centralized authority or bank putting up the funds to allow transfers to happen between parties; rather, the parties amongst themselves have to establish liquidity pools in order to facilitate swaps. In this context, someone might ‘stake’ tokens into a liquidity pool, often for a promised rate of return in exchange for the use of their tokens, with the option to withdraw their tokens later.
On the Beacon Chain and Ethereum 2.0, ‘staking’ means something a bit different: 32 ETH may be staked ( ) at a determined smart contract address in order to operate a validator on the Beacon Chain; in this way, you help ensure the good functioning and safety of the network, and are rewarded for your staking.
State channels are part of the set of tools and platforms involved in scaling Ethereum and enabling Layer 2. While a complex topic, state channels are essentially methods through which the current ‘state’ of the blockchain can be exported, and based on that any given number of transactions can take place off-chain, and then be moved back onto the main Ethereum chain.
‘Trustless’ is a term that gets used a lot in the decentralized web, and it deserves some explanation. Traditionally, to call something ‘trustless’ would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a third-party repository of ‘truth’ in whom trust resides. We don’t rely on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. In a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust, because the system works the same for everyone.
Any machine that can calculate on a level equal to a programmable computer is Turing Complete, or computationally universal. The EVM, despite not existing on a single physical computer, is Turing Complete.
A participant in Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. On the Beacon Chain, validators need to stake 32 ETH, that is to submit a sort of security deposit, in order to get included in the validator set. See also ‘staking’.
Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge are an incredible technology, and vital to the scaling of blockchain technology and the decentralized web. They are mathematically complex and can be daunting; this explanation ( ) from the Ethereum Foundation is a good primer.
If more than half the computer power or mining hash rate on a network is run by a single person or a single group of people, then a 51% attack is in operation. This means that this entity has full control of the network and can negatively affect a cryptocurrency by taking over mining operations, stopping or changing transactions, and double-spending coins.----




https://ethereum.org/en/history/

When upgrades are needed in traditional, centrally-controlled software, the company will just publish a new version for the end-user. Blockchains work differently because there is no central ownership. Ethereum clients ( ) must update their software to implement the new fork rules. Plus block creators (miners in a proof-of-work world, validators in a proof-of-stake world) and nodes must create blocks and validate against the new rules. More on consensus mechanisms ( )
These rule changes may create a temporary split in the network. New blocks could be produced according to the new rules or the old ones. Forks are usually agreed upon ahead of time so that clients adopt the changes in unison and the fork with the upgrades becomes the main chain. However, in rare cases, disagreements over forks can cause the network to permanently split – most notably the creation of Ethereum Classic with the DAO fork ( #dao-fork ).
The Arrow Glacier network upgrade pushed back the difficulty bomb ( ) by several months. This is the only change introduced in this upgrade, and is similar in nature to the Muir Glacier ( #muir-glacier ) upgrade. Similar changes have been performed on the Byzantium ( #byzantium ) , Constantinople ( #constantinople ) and London ( #london ) network upgrades.
Be sure to upgrade your client software to the latest version before December 5, 2021 to account for variable block times. This will help avoid having your client sync to a pre-fork chain, resulting in the inability to send funds or properly verify transactions.
The Altair upgrade was the first scheduled upgrade for the Beacon Chain ( ). It added support for "sync committees"—enabling light clients, and bringing validator inactivity and slashing penalties up to their full values.
Altair was the first major network upgrade that had an exact rollout time. Every upgrade prior had been based on a declared block number on the proof-of-work chain, where block times vary. The Beacon Chain does not require solving for proof-of-work, and instead works on a time-based epoch system consisting of 32 twelve-second "slots" of time where validators can propose blocks. This is why we knew exactly when we would hit epoch 74,240 and Altair became live!
The Beacon Chain ( ) needed 16384 deposits of 32 staked ETH to ship securely. This happened on November 27, meaning the Beacon Chain started producing blocks on December 1, 2020. This is an important first step in achieving the Ethereum vision ( ).
The staking deposit contract introduced staking ( ) to the Ethereum ecosystem. Although a Mainnet ( ) contract, it had a direct impact on the timeline for launching the Beacon Chain ( ) , an important Ethereum upgrade ( ).
The Muir Glacier fork introduced a delay to the difficulty bomb ( ). Increases in block difficulty of the proof-of-work ( ) consensus mechanism threatened to degrade the usability of Ethereum by increasing wait times for sending transactions and using dapps.
The DAO fork was in response to the 2016 DAO attack ( ) where an insecure DAO ( ) contract was drained of over 3.6 million ETH in a hack. The fork moved the funds from the faulty contract to a new contract ( ) with a single function: withdraw. Anyone who lost funds could withdraw 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens in their wallets.
Frontier was a live, but barebone implementation of the Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase. It was intended for technical users, specifically developers. Blocks ( ) had a gas ( ) limit of 5,000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to start their operations and for early adopters to install their clients without having to ‘rush’.----




http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/09/bitcoin-anonymous-ecash-and-strong.html

I first wrote about the idea of strong privacy in an article ( ) published in 1996, almost twenty years ago, and have returned to the subject several times since. The basic idea, inspired by the work of members of the Cyperpunk mailing list, in particular Tim May, was that public key encryption made possible a world where individuals could make their transactions invisible to third parties. In such a world it would be possible to combine anonymity and reputation by linking the reputation to an online identity but making it difficult or impossible to identify the corresponding realspace identity.
A key element of such a world is anonymous digital cash, some way of making payments, including payments to strangers, without identifying payer or payee to either third party observers or the other party. What I was imagining was something along the lines worked out by David Chaum, a Dutch cryptographer. Chaumian digital cash is issued by a realspace bank but, just as with ordinary paper currency, transactions are anonymous. The bank does not know who has made transfers to whom, and neither party to a transfer needs to know the identity of the other.
Chaumian digital cash does not yet exist, probably because it requires a realspace bank, a realspace bank requires permission, ideally protection, for the government in whose territory it exists, and governments take a dim view of a technology that would make money laundering laws undenforceable. The nearest equivalent that does exist is bitcoin, one of its virtues being that there is no issuer, hence no need for permission or protection.
Bitcoin is, in a sense, the least anonymous money that has ever existed, since every transaction is observable by anyone with a bitcoin account. Transactions are shown as between accounts, not between people. But all that is necessary to link a realspace person to at least one of his accounts is to make a bitcoin payment to him and see what account the money goes to.
That works as a way of monitoring bitcoin transactions made by a realspace identity. Suppose, however, that we have a world of strong privacy. In that imaginary world my online identity is Legal Eagle Online, selling legal advice which I cannot sell in realspace due to not being a member of my state bar. Legal Eagle makes and receives payments in bitcoins. The online identity can be linked to the account he uses by anyone who makes a payment to him. But as long as I am careful not to use his bitcoins to buy goods delivered to my realspace address,  there is no information linking Legal Eagle to me.
There are proposals to convert bitcoin into a truly anonymous ecash by using mechanisms that, as I understand them, mix coins in between transactions. How successful such projects will be I do not know. Even without them, bitcoin as it currently exists could be used as the digital currency of a world of strong privacy. It is not as good for that purpose as a fully anonymous currency would be, since the bitcoin transactions of my online identity are public. But it preserves the essential feature of such a world, the separation between online and realspace identities.
You should look into OpenTransactions: It enables chaumian transfers and voting pools, among other things. This will allow bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrency) to be transferred blind through a distributed network.
Even zerocoin etc are not fully anonymous. Nothing is ever fully anonymous. We have a hard enough time developing secure devices to hold bitcoin. to be fully anonymous, you'd have to monitor the entire internet chain etc (from your isp etc). At the end of the day nothing is 100%.
It's interesting that the thing you are describing - lawyers being paid in Bitcoin for anonymous legal advice - actually already exists, as well as anonymous medical advice. There is a site which does exactly that.
Minor corrections: it was the Cypherpunks mailing list. I'm fairly certain that Chaum is an American. When the government was most strongly prosecuting the crypto-wars, the only place Chaum could continue development was in the Netherlands, and he did get funding for a company there, but most of the foundational papers were written and published in the US.
The digital mixes you describe are workable, and you don't actually need multiple parties to make the idea work. The thing that makes currency traceable is combining multiple payments into a single wallet. If you do that, and make payments consistently from the same wallet, then anyone who pays you can see what other payments went into that wallet, and what other payments went out. But there's no requirement that a person only have one wallet.
Any bitcoin user who cares about anonymity should create a wallet for each incoming payment, and pay for goods with a collection of coins assembled into a wallet used for just that payment. Someone who pays you will be able to see all the people you paid some of those funds to, but since you don't jumble them together into a traceable wallet connected to your continuing identity, they can't assemble a coherent picture of your transactions over time.
Thanks for your thoughts, David. We will never go back to a world of Chaumian anonymous digital cash because it functioned under a centralized model where coins were sent back to the mint and then re-issued to confirm no double-spending.
Examples like 'I can perform an illegal service and take Bitcoin for payment, because it can't be traced' are pretty daft. Illegal services can and will be tracked in many ways. Trust me , I've been there.
I thought I was smart, but one error - or in my case, an advance in technology in an unrelated area that I could never have foreseen - unravels the web. Computer (algorithms) are very very good at following trails - and mass investigations based on public data have virtually zero marginal costs.
The community needs to argue that the powers of law enforcement are so enhanced these days due to the advances in computer based forensics that the old principle of follow the money is less necessary.
As Mashuri mentioned, Open Transactions makes chaumian cash possible. In OT, anonymous users can trade receipts of various assets (such as bitcoins, gold and US dollars) through financial instruments.----




https://thecontrol.co/meet-the-best-performing-digital-currency-of-2016-monero-e6010768e54a

2016 was a good year for Bitcoin ( ) and Ethereum ( ) , the two digital currencies with the most traction and public recognition. Bitcoin ended the year with a total market value of $15.6B (up over 119% Ethereum ended the year with a total market value of $699M (up over 760%).
But it turns out that a lesser-known digital currency that was quietly created by an anonymous developer on a message board ( ) in 2014 was the best performing digital currency in the world in 2016. That digital currency is Monero ( ).
*Contrary to the mainstream media portrayal of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain does not offer strong privacy protection for people who don’t want their transactions known to the world.* The Bitcoin blockchain actually reveals the public address of both the sender and receiver, the transaction amount and a timestamp for every transaction. Basic data mining can reveal the identities of senders and receivers based on the public data revealed on the blockchain. As a result of this poor privacy, there’s an opportunity for new privacy-based blockchains to create a digital currency built on a truly private payment network.
You might be wondering why any normal person would want to use a private transaction network. Some assume that if you want private transactions, you must have bad intentions. It is true that illegal activities could be an early use case of the technology, but that has been the case throughout the history of technology (see the cover of Time during the early stays of the Internet in 1995 ( ) ). The reality is financial privacy is a fundamental human desire and a private payment network could have major benefits for all people.
Monero (symbol XMR) is the current leader of the privacy-focused digital currencies. The Monero developers’ breakthrough, “Spontaneous Ring Signatures”, was created to mask the source of funds so that the specific signers of transactions can’t be specified. The details on this privacy innovation can be found here ( ).
While there are several blockchains that have implemented privacy solutions (e.g. Zcash ( ) and Dash ( ) ) and also a few proposals for implementations of privacy features on top of the largest blockchains (e.g. Mimblewimble ( ) and Confidential Transactions ( ) ), Monero currently has the most momentum of all the live privacy projects. See the chart below for details on how the competition stacks up in terms of market value, % increase in market value, average daily transactions, developer activity and hashing power.
One of the most interesting aspects of Monero is that the project has gained traction without a crowd sale pre-launch ( ) , without VC funding ( ) and any company or well-known investors and without a pre-mine ( ). Like Bitcoin in the early days, Monero has been a purely grassroots movement that was bootstrapped by the creator and adopted organically without any institutional buy-in. The creator and most of the core developers serve the community pseudonymously ( ) and the project was launched on a message board (similar to the way Bitcoin was launched on an email newsletter).
Zcash has only been live for 3 months, but it has received more funding and publicity, has a well-known creator ( ) and has well-known investors publicly backing it ( ). For traditional startups, these are significant advantages. But it remains to be seen how important known, well-respected founders, publicity, traditional funding and well-known investors actually are for blockchains — only time will tell.
* *Economic:* The network effects that Bitcoin and Ethereum have over Monero could prove tough to compete with over time. If Bitcoin and Ethereum are able to build in privacy-features natively (through Confidential Transactions, Mimblewimble, or something else), Monero adoption may stall.
* *Psychological:* Because it is decentralized and lacks a charismatic leader and institutional buy-in, it may be difficult for Monero to move past crypto-anarchist users. This could allow Zcash or other privacy focused projects to secure more integrations and partnerships with wallets, exchanges and merchants. The Alphabay ( ) integration was important for the trajectory of Monero in ‘16 and future integrations are crucial to adoption (note: just yesterday Kraken added Monero ( ) to its exchange).
* *Technical:* There are some theorized vulnerabilities ( ) in the anonymity of Monero. For example, sophisticated data mining could emerge to render ring signatures ineffective at hiding the sender, which would challenge Monero’s usefulness as a private transaction network.
*About me:* Nick runs The Control ( ) and is an investor at Runa Capital ( ) , an early stage venture fund. Previously, Nick worked on business development and marketing at Coinbase ( ) and as an Associate at North Atlantic Capital ( ). Nick’s work has been featured in publications like the Wall Street Journal ( ) and Entrepreneur and he has guest lectured at the Yale School of Management.----

As in XRP’s pros such as limited supply, high demand, amazing tech, the most potential out of any coin really other than the gold Bitcoin that will remain always the top because of it’s quantity. Well Ripple’s pro’s in general as well as their technology overall and it’s usefulness and effectiveness with little to no cost to transact etc. Instant easy to accomplish transactions,
But regardless of the agenda CNBC is pushing XRP will remain or SPARK will take over. Either or but ripple tech isn’t going away no matter what the mainstream media, banksters, elite etc attempt to do to ripple in any regard. XRP holders know this to be true by studying it’s uses (coingecko is amazing for github, whitepages etc to view the code for yourself as well as many other uses). Further links to self research Ripple and XRP etc are provided below. If you have not researched Ripple’s tech at the very least I highly suggest that you do. Anyway that is just my thoughts on the matter for now. I’m always happy to discuss further and hear different opinions and perspectives. So please add a comment below and I will be happy to continue the discussion. Cheers.
At network launch, each account that has claimed Spark will receive 15% of the total Spark for which they are eligible. This is 15% of the Spark claimable term in the equation above. The remaining Spark claimable will be distributed over a minimum of 25 months and a maximum of 34 months.
For example, if person X has 1000 Spark claimable and 4% is picked every month by the FTSO, they receive 100015% = 150 Spark at day 1, and then (1000–150)4% = 34 additional Spark per month for 25 months, coming to a total of 1000 Spark.
The average of the pseudorandom number draws should equate to 3% per month, the midpoint between 2 and 4. At this rate, the distribution will be complete within 34 months. The process runs until either all Spark have been distributed (minimum 25 months) or 34 months have passed. At 34 months, any remaining undistributed Spark is burned or distributed based on a governance vote. (If there is a burning event this reduces the amount of tokens that an individual receives overall, but their percentage ownership of the token remains unchanged.)----

That’s because major companies like PayPal and Overstock.com now accept cryptocurrency as payment and Tesla founder Elon Musk made headlines when he snapped up $1.5 billion worth ( ) of cryptocurrency earlier this year.
Even if you have no intention of jumping on the crypto train, it’s worth knowing more about it — if only to understand how a 2013 dog meme joke ( ) evolved into the sixth largest new digital currency. (No, really). Here’s a look at some of the most common cryptocurrency terms to help break down what it’s all about.
But first, what exactly is cryptocurrency? Essentially, it’s an unregulated digital form of payment that sprung up in 2009 with the invention of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. (Etherium comes in second.)
Unlike currencies like the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen, cryptocurrencies aren’t regulated by any government and the transactions don’t go through a bank. Instead, cryptocurrency transactions happen online and are recorded on an encrypted digital ledger.
*Blockchain:* The online digital ledger that is used to record a series of verified public cryptocurrency transactions. This database stores information in “blocks,” — each holding a set number of past cryptocurrency exchanges — that are then connected together. Although blockchain technology was created for the use of bitcoin, it’s also being explored for use in everything from shipping and healthcare to banking.

*Market cap:* The total market value of all of a specific cryptocurrency’s coins. To find out the market value, multiply the number of outstanding coins by the current price of the coins. Some types of cryptocurrency have a set limit of coins that can be “mined” every year. In the case of bitcoin, the founders decided to create a lifetime limit of 21 million bitcoins that can be uncovered.
*Mining:* The process used to uncover new units of a type of cryptocurrency. People known as “crypto miners” use technology and hardware to solve complicated equations to verify new blocks of cryptocurrency that get added to the blockchain. As a reward for their work, miners receive digital tokens.
*Private and public keys:* Pieces of information consisting of a string of letters and numbers that people can use to access their crypto holdings. Public keys are similar to bank account numbers and are used to make deposits.
Private keys are similar to a debit card PIN and allow people to access their digital cryptocurrency holdings. It’s critical to never forget or lose your private key because there’s no way to access your wallet if you do.----

Material discrepancies in an examination must be reported to the commissioner within one day. The commissioner shall review examination results upon receipt within a reasonable time and during any regular examination conducted.
(D)    Digital assets held in custody under this section are not depository liabilities or assets of the bank. A bank or a subsidiary may register as an investment adviser, investment company, or broker-dealer as necessary. A bank shall maintain control over a digital asset while in custody. A customer shall elect, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody:
(E)    If a customer makes an election under subsection (D)(2), the bank may, based only on customer instructions, undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank maintains control pursuant to subsection (D) by entering into an agreement with the counterparty to a transaction which contains a time for return of the asset. The bank is not liable for any loss suffered with respect to a transaction under this subsection, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian under this section.
(F)    A bank and a customer shall agree in writing regarding the source code version the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset under the Uniform Commercial Code, if necessary. Any ambiguity under this subsection must be resolved in favor of the customer.

We combine Bloomberg’s global leadership in business and financial news and data, with Quintillion Media’s deep expertise in the Indian market and digital news delivery, to provide high quality business news, insights and trends for India’s sophisticated audiences.
A new regulatory timeline foresees finalizing a framework in three to six months, after the publication of proposals ( ) earlier in June that requires public comment before approval, according to Kuben Naidoo, chief executive officer of South Africa’s banking regulator known as the Prudential Authority.
“We are trying to put in place the regulatory framework quickly,” said Naidoo, who’s also a deputy governor of the South African central bank. “Our view is that crypto is a financial product and should be regulated as a financial product.”
The approach that’s taking shape means tougher rules could be imminent this year after a jolt of scandals that most recently included a suspected Ponzi scheme ( ) , which resulted in the disappearance of an estimated $3.6 billion in Bitcoin.
“Now we are defining this as a financial product and if there are scams where the public is being duped, given incorrect or false information, it is certainly a market conduct issue that should be taken seriously,” Naidoo said.
South African cryptocurrency service providers have been operating unchecked by regulatory powers even as the popularity of the asset class has taken off. Last year, the collapse ( ) of Johannesburg-based Mirror Trading International was called the biggest crypto-related scam of 2020 by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

In one of the most significant moves to date by a regulator amid a global crackdown, Binance Markets Ltd. was banned ( ) Sunday by the U.K. financial watchdog from doing any regulated business in the country. Huobi, one of the most popular cryptocurrency platforms in China, said Monday that users in the country are prohibited from trading derivatives.
Under global regulators’ plans ( ) to ward off threats to financial stability from the volatile market, banks will face the toughest capital requirements for holdings in Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that a 1,250% risk weight be applied to a bank’s exposure to Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies.
Regulators in South Africa will first move to establish know-your-customer rules for crypto exchanges and create systems for the surveillance of the asset class in order to prevent money being laundered out of the country, Naidoo said. Thereafter, investor-protection guidelines and rules for managing capital risk in the banking sector should come into effect.
In a speech on Wednesday, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said an inter-department working group that includes government agencies, the central bank and law enforcement is planning to “closely monitor the evolution of cryptocurrencies.”
“Cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly within the current regulatory framework,” he said. “One of the unique features of cryptocurrency is its ability to operate without third-party intermediaries or similar safety mechanisms. The consequence though is that the potential financial and consumer risks are quite pronounced.”
“Any incidents of fraud draw attention to the importance of regulation and we hope that the clear guidelines in South Africa -- and globally -- could lead to wider adoption by enhancing stability and trust in the market,” said Marius Reitz, general manager in Africa for Luno.
“Regulations will also raise standards and barriers to entry and weed out bad actors or service providers with a low regard and capability to safeguard customer information and money,” Reitz said.----

“In my opinion, anything to do with a crypto is highly suspect and nobody should be invested in anything form of cryptocurrency or any of the products that go with it,” the Financial Sector Conduct Authority’s Brandon Topham told a media briefing on Wednesday.
But many have lost money, and most recently the FSCA issued a warning about Mirror Trading International ( ) , which accepts clients’ funds in the form of Bitcoin, which are then used to trade foreign currencies. MTI claims to have more than R2.9 billion in clients’ funds in trading accounts, but the FSCA says it has not been able to “conclusively confirm” that the funds exist.
“It’s extremely high risk,” Topham said, equating “playing” in cryptocurrencies with gambling. But he said that those who are interested in cryptocurrency should “rather go to the casino” – because at least gambling establishments are regulated and registered in South Africa.
Earlier this year, the FSCA, the Reserve Bank and other parties published a policy paper about plans to regulate service providers in the cryptocurrency industry, including trading platforms, providers of vending machines, issuers of cryptocurrencies or tokens, providers of investments or derivatives of crypto assets, digital wallet providers, and providers of custody services.
Caroline da Silva, outgoing executive of regulatory policy at FSCA, also warned intermediaries that it is illegal to use any licence issued under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act as cover to offer cryptocurrency.----




https://bitcoingold.org/responding-to-attacks/

We have recently sent a detailed memo to the Exchanges who carry Bitcoin Gold, but we also wanted to be transparent and share information with the public. (If you’re with an Exchange that has not received the memo, please get in touch via the usual channels or [email protected] ( ).)
As anyone watching our Twitter or Forum posts ( ) was aware, there have been recent “51% Attacks” done using the Bitcoin Gold blockchain over a span of about three and a half days in May to attack Exchanges with something called a “Double Spend.”
This is not due to some flaw in blockchain technology; any blockchain – even Bitcoin – can theoretically be attacked by a malicious actor who can control more hashing (computing) power than all the honest miners. Of course, the biggest risk is to a smaller network in the shadow of a bigger one. Bitcoin has an order of magnitude more hashpower than some other coins mined with the same SHA256 algorithm, like Bitcoin Cash and Digibyte, so Bitcoin is relatively safe. Likewise, Zcash has an order of magnitude more hashpower than other coins mined with Equihash, like Bitcoin Gold, ZenCash, and Komodo, so Zcash is relatively safe.
So, why target us, and not another Equihash-based coin? Frankly, it’s likely because we are on more large Exchanges, with significant liquidity and fairly deep order books – these are necessary for an attacker to be able to profit from such an attack. And, as news reports show, we’re neither the first ( ) nor the last ( ) coin to be attacked this May.
Ordinary users aren’t at risk, funds held as BTG aren’t at risk, and any trades with known partners aren’t a risk, either. The only real danger is to anyone who unknowingly trades directly with the attackers for very large sums on an automated system. In other words, Exchanges.
The power to perform such an attack is expensive – the attackers need to control a huge wave of mining power. So mounting an attack is costly and, if it fails, will lose money. Attempting such attacks to steal $100 or $1000 can’t be profitable, but attacks for much larger dollar values will tempt criminals to attack Exchanges, and so they did. You can read more about how a Double-Spend attack works here ( ).
While this problem isn’t unique to Bitcoin Gold and doesn’t represent a flaw, we consider our Exchanges to be critical partners in our Ecosystem, so in a theoretical sense, attacks on Exchanges are attacks on us all. And even when the attacker fails to steal BTC or some other currency from an Exchange after their double-spend, their 51% attack causes a “reorganization” on the blockchain, which is disruptive to honest users and steals mining revenue from honest miners… this means they literally are an attack on us all.
To help them protect themselves, we’re monitoring the situation carefully in a variety of ways to rapidly alert the Exchanges when we can tell an attack is in progress. (The last known attempt was on May 19th.) This is why many Exchanges dramatically increased their confirmation requirements, or else closed their deposit wallets entirely. Of course, we need to be in close contact to be able to alert them promptly – any Exchange that has not yet joined our emergency communications channels should reach out to the team immediately!
Most of you also know that we were already planning a major upgrade soon, near the end of June. This was to change our Proof of Work algorithm so that BTG could not be mined on upcoming ASIC hardware – we expect ASIC hardware to ship from Bitmain around then, potentially delivering a huge wave of mining power, and we don’t want that to impact our existing miners.
We’ll provide another update with a progress report on the testnet status within another three days, or sooner if it’s ready; we aim to be able to give a firm date for the actual mainnet upgrade at that time.----




https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/double-spend-attacks-on-exchanges/1362/21

That is not a valid indication. If the attacker does private mining and then releases their longer chain to reorg the existing one - it wouldn’t be noticed in the hashrate. The hashrate is estimated based on how often a block is found and is unrelated to the attack.
He mined 9 blocks in the mainnet with his attacking node connected. His block times were between 100 and 160 seconds apart. You can calculate howmuch hash power you need for the current network difficulty in order to produce block for that time
This raises a side point: a 50% attack could done by half the existing miners (if >20 M of our 40 M decided to coordinate and cheat), or it can be done by bringing in outside hashpower (someone brings in >40M to out-power our 40M.)
Note that orphaned blocks can be explored in explorer.bitcoingold.org ( ) by entering the block hash - searching on the block number will always return the mainchain block, not the orphaned block, but entering the actual hash will show a block that was orphaned.
The attacker needs to spend some money to to mine enough block to perform the 51% attack. In order to revert n blocks, the cost should be around (n+1) * 12.5 BTG, where n is the confirmations required by the exchange. A 21 block attack will cost around 262.5 BTG.
Besides the money stolen by the double spending, the attacker may also get back close to 90% of the cost after a successful attack because the mining rewards will belong to the attacker (and can be moved after 100 more blocks have passed.)
Given the cost of a (successful) attack is effectively (n+1) * 12.5 * 10% BTG (or 26.25 BTG for 20 confirmations) is relatively small, the definition of a “large transaction” is mostly up to the exchange.
However, the attacker also takes some risks. When the attack fails, all the cost to mine the private chain will be lost. That will be around (n+1)*12.5 BTG. If the exchange is aware of the attack, they may also freeze his account, so that all the funds will be locked inside the Exchange. A failed 21 block attack performed with a 10,000 BTG deposit where the Exchange freezes the account in time will result in a 10,262.5 BTG loss for the attacker.
Because the private blockchain is longer than the public one (which is possible with more than 51% of the hashpower), the existing blocks will be reverted, and replaced by the privately mined blocks. The deposit to the Exchange will never have happened, being replaced by the transaction to the attacker himself.
and right after the difficulty fell, they are back at mining full speed. So basically they are milking the BTG network out of the mining rewards and leave the rest of the miners to mine the hardest blocks. It’s a vicious circle.
The worse part is, this may no longer be considered an attack (unless they still orphan some blocks, but it looks like they stopped) and it may just be a consequence of being a smaller coin amongst coins sharing one algorithm. PoW change may indeed solve this but only if BTG is using an Equihash variation that noone else uses.
Also true. The PoW change means we will leave the “big pond” of Equihash power for the “small pond” of EquihashDifferent power - a pond where we are the biggest fish, so the risk will be lower (until others choose to use the same EquihashDifferent power that we do, which will bring more water into our pond.)
Also of note, our upcoming fork includes improvements to the DAA - Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm. If our Difficulty adjusts more rapidly to the incoming surge of hashpower, the participants in the surge will earn fewer “excess” coins, limiting their profit. This will also make malicious attacks more expensive. This will help protect the steady miners and smooth out the flow of blocks.
If he’s able to lower the difficulty during selfish mining by something like timestamp manipulation, it might help the precision of deciding when to take it public and beat the public chain, but it does not directly help him. He has to do more chain work which is difficulty x blocks, not number of blocks. If he cuts difficulty to he has to mine 2x more blocks to beat the public chain. He’s got 2x more blocks, but he’s not getting those blocks cheaply as h4x3rotab explained. It’s the double spends he gains on.
What is the feasibility of using a hybrid PoW algo combining or PoW&PoS for example 2 ASIC resistant algos together and specify one for odd blocks and the other for even blocks, this way the attacker mining private chain to perform 51% attack will need more resources in two different algorithms to produce longer chain than the rest of the network. dose anyone here thinks this might help secure BTG?----

The red-hot market for nonfungible tokens ( ) , or NFTs, continues to draw regulatory scrutiny. A Department of the Treasury report ( ) issued on February 4, 2022, is the latest to focus on potential regulatory issues associated with this digital asset class.
The intersection of retail sales and blockchain technology is a current “hot” topic. But what does this actually mean for retailers? Is the time and money needed to invest in new technology worth the cost? What intellectual property (IP) protection is available?
On January 20, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published a discussion paper ( ) on the potential for a US central bank digital currency, or CBDC.  Entitled “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation,” the paper provides further insight into the public policy concerns guiding the Fed as it deliberates whether to adopt a US CBDC.

In connection with a December 14, 2021, hearing ( ) of the Senate Banking Committee focused on the topic of stablecoins, Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-PA) released ( ) a collection of principles that he hopes will influence the development of a future legislative framework for the asset class. Senator Toomey’s principles offer a more flexible approach to stablecoins in contrast to the approach embraced in a recent report ( ) on stablecoins released by the President’s Working Group, which advocated for limiting stablecoin issuances to entities that are insured depository institutions under the oversight of federal banking regulators.
On December 6, 2021, the Biden administration released a first-of-its-kind, comprehensive US Strategy on Countering Corruption ( ).  The Strategy addresses all angles of the fight against corruption: prevention, investigation, exposure, and prosecution.  To accomplish this, it relies on a whole-of-government approach resting on five “pillars”: Continue Reading Biden Administration Announces US Strategy on Countering Corruption ( )
On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “Infrastructure Bill”), which significantly expands tax information reporting for certain cryptocurrency transactions. The Infrastructure Bill includes an information reporting requirement for cryptocurrency asset exchanges and custodians on an IRS Form 1099, and an information reporting requirement for certain persons who accept large payments in cryptocurrency in such person’s trade or business on an IRS Form 8300. The effective date of these changes will apply to any information return required to be filed after December 31, 2023. Continue Reading New Cryptocurrency Information Reporting Regime Required on Form 1099 and Form 8300 ( )
On December 1, 2021, Freddie Mac published Bulletin 2021-36 ( ) for Freddie Mac sellers to provide updated guidance on eligibility criteria for qualifying mortgages. Freddie Mac publishes such bulletins on a regular basis for loan originators who wish to resell mortgages to Freddie Mac, and Bulletin 2021-36 covers a number of routine topics such as 2022 conforming loan limits, certain credit underwriting criteria and document custody. The bulletin is notable, however, because it specifically addresses requirements related to cryptocurrency’s use in the mortgage qualification process.
On November 23, 2021, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs sent a series of letters to prominent stablecoin issuers and cryptocurrency exchanges. Citing the recent President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report ( ) on stablecoins, the letters seek to clarify basic operational features of various stablecoins which the Committee believes is critical to improving its understanding of digital assets.
On 25 October 2021, the Dubai Financial Services Authority ( *DFSA* ), the regulatory body of the Dubai International Financial Centre ( *DIFC* ), announced that it implemented a regulatory framework for investment tokens issued or traded within the DIFC ( *Regulatory Framework for Investment Tokens* ), which follows from the Consultation Paper No. 138 ( Regulation of Security Tokens ) ( ) it issued earlier in March this year. Consequently, the UAE advances its status as a hub for technological innovation (and entrepreneurs); it fully embraces the global adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, as well as the demand for Investment Tokens, and the number of companies within the DIFC that are eager to issue, and trade in them, is steadily on the rise.

https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/bitcoin-market-cap-80-billion/

Vyacheslav Images Bitcoin may have hit historic highs in December 2017, but just one month into the new year, investors are feeling the pinch of a major correction. Following a slight dip towards the end of last year, bitcoin has crashed hard in the weeks that followed, leading to a fall in market cap of more than $80 billion.
Although bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices are regularly discussed in terms of individual token prices, the sheer number of tokens out there means that the entire market of any individual cryptocurrency can be worth billions. In the case of bitcoin, it was worth more than $200 billion at the start of 2018, but already that’s fallen to $143 billion at the time of writing. Other cryptocurrencies have been similarly impacted, though Ethereum has managed to remain in the black, despite similarly volatile peaks and troughs.
This should all come as no real surprise to long-term cryptocurrency evangelists, as the digital currencies have always been volatile in nature. It was only in 2017 that their value seemed only able to increase. Crashes have happened before, with this latest one spurred by a combination of mistaken reporting related to statements made by India’s finance minister ( ) , as well as Facebook’s announcement that it would no longer support ICO and cryptocurrency advertisements. As BusinessInsider points out ( ) , the subpoenas levied against major exchanges Bitfenix and Tether didn’t help either.
This latest crash is a big one, though. At the time of writing bitcoin has fallen to $8,500, its lowest figure since the end of November last year. However, despite all of the negativity surrounding the flagship cryptocurrency, many in bitcoin social circles ( ) claim that holding on to your coins is far better than panic selling.
They may have at least some good reasons to do so. Acceptance of bitcoin in various online outlets is only increasing and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey also announced just a few days ago that full bitcoin support with the Cash App ( ). That should make it easier than ever for those without much understanding of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to buy their own.
As scary as the prospect of regulation can be, we don’t think it will have the teeth some fear ( ) it may develop in the future. With enough evangelists still touting bitcoin as “gold 2.0, ( ) ” it seems unlikely to fall from relevance anytime soon, even if its latest bubble has well and truly burst.----

BITCOIN and other cryptocurrencies do not have a "guaranteed value" and should come with a "clear and frequent" warning to investors in order to safeguard them from possible risks to their investments, EU financial services commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said.
We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. More info ( )
He said: " Cryptocurrencies ( ) – which are not currencies in a traditional sense and whose value is not guaranteed – have become subject to considerable speculation: this exposes consumers and investors to substantial risk, including risks to lose their investment.
Speaking to the press following a roundtable discussing the challenges and opportunities of crypto trading, Mr Dombrovkis said: "We do not exclude the possibility to move ahead by regulating crypto-currencies at the EU level if we see, for example, risks emerging but no clear international response emerging.”
But despite calls for caution from investors, the EU Commissioner suggested Brussels recognised the technological importance of the structure driving the trade of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – the blockchain.
Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology has been repeatedly championed as the foundation for a new kind of global finance. However after nearly a decade of hype, real working examples of its value have been few and far between.----

"In terms of how it ends, bubble history suggests it will be with a bang, rather than a whimper," said Sharon Zoller, an economist at ANZ. "I can't think of any reason why this time would be different."
Hard data from those days is scarce, so it's difficult to gauge exactly how much prices soared. But people were putting up their homes as collateral ( ) , according to the Rijksmuseum -- the Museum of the Netherlands -- in Amsterdam.
Like many bubbles, prices were driven by greed or the fear of missing out. Speculators were buying bulbs in the hope that they could sell them on at an even higher price. Again, it didn't last. A flurry of sales caused a domino effect, and prices collapsed.

In the space of a few years, Bitcoin has gone from an idea ignored or maligned by almost everyone to an asset with a market cap of more than $12 billion. Venture capital firms, Goldman Sachs, the New York Stock Exchange, and billionaires such as Richard Branson and Peter Thiel have invested more than $1 billion in companies built on this groundbreaking technology. Bill Gates has even declared it ‘better than currency’.
The pioneers of Bitcoin were twenty-first-century outlaws – cryptographers, hackers, Free Staters, ex-cons and drug dealers, teenage futurists and self-taught entrepreneurs – armed with a renegade ideology and a grudge against big government and big banks. Now those same institutions are threatening to co-opt or curtail the impact of digital currency. But the pioneers, some of whom have become millionaires themselves, aren’t going down without a fight. Sweeping and provocative, How Money Got Free reveals how this disruptive technology is shaping the debate around competing ideas of money and liberty, and what that means for our future.

‘Eha pieces together the puzzle of Bitcoin’s history in an engaging and accessible narrative… A great choice for anyone interested in technology, finance, politics, or the currency they spend.’ ― Library Journal
‘ The definitive early history of the cryptocurrency revolution… Everyone has a take, an opinion, but precious few can articulate it in any kind of compelling way. Mr. Eha indeed hangs around early business venture booms and busts just long enough to give Bitcoiners fantastic inside-baseball morsels while helping those new to the anarchic culture feel welcome. How Money Got Free is exactly where it needs to be, here and now. Perfect timing.’ ― Foundation for Economic Education
‘If Brian Patrick Eha can make me, a Luddite dunce, both understand and care about the enigmatic Bitcoin, and if he can also tantalize the novelist in me with a narrative of intellectual daring and primal risk…then he is some kind of journalistic magician. And so he is, because he did all those things and more… You’ll never find a better guide.’ -- Walter Kirn, author of Up in the Air and Blood Will Out

I went into this book afraid it would be a pretty dry economics tome or an overly technical text for money wonks and people who know a lot more about banking regulations or software development than I do. My fears were instantly eliminated. This is a thrilling nonfiction narrative in the mode of Michael Lewis, but with maybe deeper insight and more serious intent. It doesn't just showcase a weird, wild or shadowy part of the financial world, it tells the story of a technology that is changing that world (and maybe the rest of the world too). Parts of the book ARE weird, wild and shadowy, don't get me wrong, but the author isn't out to be salacious. He actually seems to take the technology as seriously as the people (and vice versa). And he's willing to challenge received wisdom and show the existing system warts and all. Hardly anybody in here comes off looking like a saint. But they're really fascinating, eccentric, brilliant people. While you're riding along with this cast of characters, you also learn a lot about economics and crypto-anarchy, startup culture (like bros smoking pot in their company office after hours), the dark web and black market drugs, blockchain and a new border-hopping way of life that's possible thanks to Bitcoin, the borderless money. Bitcoin is in the news so much lately that I wanted to understand it better, where it comes from and who is behind it. (The media is pretty weak when it comes to that.) And I did come away from How Money Got Free with a great understanding of that stuff. But the story comes first. And it's a really freaking good story. I've already lent my copy to a friend but told him if he likes it he has to buy his own!
I really enjoyed How Money Got Free. The writing is clear and interesting and the history of Bitcoin is told as a story that unfolds with all the mystery and thrill of a good novel. Eha does a good job of covering the trajectory of Bitcoin's development without losing sight of the people in the stories. They are real and sympathetic. I wanted to find out what happened to them and that made the book easy to read. Along the way, I learned things about Bitcoin that I didn't know before, despite the fact that I've been studying Bitcoin and the blockchain for several years.
This is a remarkable piece of journalism in both its breadth and its depth. Trust me when I say you will learn things--from economics to emerging technology, Silicon Valley culture to business regulation, currency, computers, and everything in between, Eha has really done his homework, and it shows. And somehow, it never feels like a lecture; instead, Eha coaxes his audience up a subtle learning curve simply by giving us a book we'll want to keep reading.
In fact, the real beauty of the piece is that the story has a life to it. Unlike some narrative non-fiction that can be dry (and hard to get through), How Money Got Free is a really enjoyable book to read. Eha has managed to seamlessly weave an immense amount of factual information into a compelling narrative about truly vivid characters. It's not often that a work of nonfiction gets called a "page-turner," but here the label fits.
Riveting! "How Money Got Free" should be a movie or miniseries. The mysterious Bitcoin is not only fully revealed, told through the personal stories of those involved, it reads like a thriller, a page-turner, that will likely keep you up late into the night. The remarkable story and exceptional writing make this book a recommend to anyone!
Purchased this book after hearing someone I respect give it praise! Was not let down! I am amazed at how much information is in this book on the history of digital currencies. You want to be the digital currency historian of your group-this book is an excellent start. Investors, bankers, cryptokids, pick up a copy of this book and enlighten yourself with a great story about a group of people who took matters into their own hands because they knew what they were doing was important.
Excellent read-well done Brian Patrick Eha- look forward to another book on a totally different subject! Your writing style is great and you really made me feel as if I was a part of the history-watching from the walls.
What an incredibly journey of a read! I had been aware of bitcoin's existence since 2012, but had given little thought to this monetary curiosity beyond parlor conversation. Unbeknownst to me, the last decade has been a financial revolutionary war! Brian composes this story with all the wonderful, vivid, and terrible detail of a war correspondent. "How Money Got Free" reads as if Brian was personally bearing witness and lending his extraordinary voice to the creation of a "wrench that [was thrown] into the infernal engines of global finance". A definite must-read for anyone with a passing interest in money.
The overriding feeling I have having read this book is that of immediacy of the events the book captures. That's clearly warranted given that 2015-16 is where we are left standing by the time the last page turns. If Blockchain does deliver on its promise, having read the book with its detailing of the what-might-be monumental philosophical stands and events, it's comforting to know that future is still to be made and we are not that much removed from its foundations.----

The past decade has seen cryptocurrencies rise from relatively unknown fringe currencies to headline-hitting digital assets capable of shaking up the financial industry. These currencies have recently become one of the most valuable assets on the planet ( ) , and experts predict that coming years could continue to see their usage surge. But while this is great news for investors, the rise of cryptocurrency isn’t completely without its downsides.
One of the key problems of cryptocurrencies lies in the environmental impact that digital transactions have. The process of mining for bitcoin is particularly energy-intensive, due to the complex mathematical calculations that must be completed to create each and every new bitcoin. Consider this on a global scale, and you might be surprised to hear that the amount of power needed to deal in cryptocurrencies is similar to that of a small country ( ).
With concern over the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies growing, increasing numbers of investors are looking for new ways to enjoy the benefits of digital currencies in more eco-friendly ways. Of course, no two cryptocurrencies are the same – and this extends to the environmental impact of the currencies too.
The term cryptocurrency was relatively unheard of 10 years ago, but it’s since become widely recognised. It refers to forms of digital or virtual currencies which are based in the art of cryptography, using highly complex encryption algorithms. They are designed to be incredibly secure, with virtually no chance of counterfeiting, these digital assets are resistant to inflation and easily portable.
Bitcoin is perhaps the most famous form of cryptocurrency. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was launched in 2009. The developer behind it is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, but this is a pseudonym. In fact, the real identity of its creator remains somewhat of a mystery, with several high profile scientists and engineers ( ) claiming that they were behind the world-famous digital currency.
Terms like cryptocurrency and blockchain are often used interchangeably, but they actually have quite different meanings. Blockchain is the very technology that cryptocurrencies rely on. It forms the basis of some of the best-known digital currencies in the world, such as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn’t the only currency that uses blockchain technology, of course. Many virtual assets rely on this digital ledger. Using cryptography, blockchain links a huge list of records, which have since become known as blocks. The information in each block can never be altered, because every block is linked through the data held within it. It’s this incredibly robust level of security which has led to blockchain-based currencies becoming so popular.
As cryptocurrencies have become more widely known, they have begun to be recognised by more organisations across the world. And this recognition has led to spiralling interest in the digital currencies, and a rapid rise in their value.
Tesla CEO and Chairman Elon Musk recently announced that the company’s electric cars could be bought using Bitcoin ( ) , and that this Bitcoin would then be held by the company, rather than being immediately converted into a traditional currency. The announcement caused a huge surge in interest, and a significant rise in the value of the currency itself.
Interest in cryptocurrencies remains high. Experts are predicting a steady rise ( ) for many of the best-known currencies over the coming months and years. But the real question is, will cryptocurrencies transform the entire financial system in the future? These digital assets have been positioned to do exactly that, and many feel that such a feat is entirely possible.
Digital assets such as Bitcoin have a considerable environmental footprint, due to the amount of energy required to power the algorithms behind them. While this could theoretically be done using renewable energy, in reality it usually isn’t. China is a leading player in mining for Bitcoin, and 60% of the energy ( ) it uses to do so is powered by coal.
Think about the enormous scale of cryptocurrencies, and the growing demand for Bitcoin mining, and you can see the problem. Currently, blockchain-based currencies are using as much energy as many small countries, yet their popularity continues to grow. And as demand increases, so too will the energy requirements of this industry.
While cryptocurrencies on the whole tend to be fairly damaging to the environment, some types of digital currency are known for having less of an impact than others. Research compiled by TRG Datacenters, based in Houston ( ) , Texas has highlighted the most eco-friendly options, ranking them by the amount of energy required to power each transaction:
A new wave of eco-friendly cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity. Ones that seek to limit the impact of transactions. Chia and IOTA (mentioned in the table above) are prime examples of this. The farming process for Chia doesn’t rely on the heavy processing power of mining and thus consumes less energy than other popular currencies (~ 0.023 KWh per transaction). Similarly, IOTA uses an alternative to blockchain called the ‘Tangle’ which essentially removes the need for miners. Instead, the network is maintained by smaller devices and uses calculations that require less power and thus consume less energy per transaction (~0.00011 KWh).
Another example is Nano ( ) , a digital currency network which shuns traditional mining practices in favour of a more eco-friendly solution. Nano seeks to eliminate the waste that’s usually associated with cryptocurrency transactions, using a more lightweight consensus protocol. Known as Open Representative Voting (ORV), the protocol promises minimal energy consumption and maximum efficiency.
With concern growing over the ecological impact of blockchain-based currencies, developers are increasingly turning their attention towards these newer ways of offering all the benefits of digital currencies, without the hefty carbon footprint.
As awareness of the power-hungry nature of many of the world’s best-known cryptocurrencies continues to grow, we can expect to see some big changes in both the practices of existing currency providers and the development and creation of new blockchain-based currencies. Keep an eye out for more eco-friendly digital currencies on the horizon – ones created with sustainability in mind.
TRG believes in building towards a more sustainable future, that’s why we’re introducing a new way of thinking about data center design. Moving from grid-supported, to grid-suporting. As Chris Hinkle, CTO of TRG Datacenters, explains “Utilizing different generation methodologies allows for us to change how we think about our relationship with the grid. Instead of designing data centers to be supported by the grid, we are now designing data centers to have a place supporting the grid – thereby cementing the role of compute as part of the grid as an ancillary service provider and contributor to the stability of the local community.” Find out more here ( ).
Any currencies that had conflicting KWh published in different sources were extensively cross referenced with the goal of seeing which number repeated itself the most in order to present accurate data.
Some smaller currencies do not have as much information published around them, so the consumption per transaction was calculated using the data available (e.g. yearly consumption per transaction x and transaction number per day).----

http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining

This page is both a technical documentation and advocacy of the new mining protocol which can be used for bitcoin mining. If you're a casual miner or just a regular bitcoin user, then you don't have to understand everything in this document.
The main reason why I designed this protocol and implemented opensource pool server is that the current getwork&LP mining protocol has many flaws and it can hardly be used in any large-scale setup. ASIC miners are probably coming at the end of the year 2012, so Bitcoin community definitely needs some solution, which will easily scale to tera-hashes per second per pool user...
However pool server knows much better when clients need new mining jobs. HTTP was designed for web site browsing where clients ask servers for specific content. Pooled mining is different - server knows very well what clients need and can control the communication in a more efficient way. Let’s swap roles and leave orchestration to the server!
Nowadays, for every received job from the server, a miner can modify only ntime and nonce. Nonce is a 32bit integer (4.2 billion of iterations). Ntime is a 32bit integer storing UNIX timestamp and should reflect current time, although optimized miners roll ntime slightly into the future, which gives more combinations to miners (nonce range * ntime range). However, a block created from massively modified ntime can be rejected by Bitcoin network.
Strictly following getwork specification, one getwork job is enough for mining rig and (thanks to ntime rolling) this job is usable for one minute or until a new Bitcoin block arrives (depending on what happens first). So, for 42 rig you’ll need 10 getwork requests at once , but usually a few more because of some pre-caching strategies implemented by miners to prevent idling on network latencies. And what about 1 ASIC miners coming soon? We simply need some solution where network load is not at all bounded to miners performance.
Getwork came as an easy solution for building standalone miners (do you remember when the official Bitcoin client was the only miner?), much before I built my first Bitcoin pool and when frequent polling of local bitcoin daemon wasn't an issue. When pools came into the game, people found out that they must decide between short polling intervals (=higher network load, lower stale ratio) and intervals, which don't overload network and servers, but lead to a much higher ratio of rejected shares. And long polling pattern was the answer. Long polling is a great way to achieve real-time updates using standard web technologies. But as I already mentioned in the text above, web technologies are not ideal for Bitcoin mining.
Long polling uses separate connection to pool server, which leads to various issues on server side, like load balancing of connections between more backends. Load balancing using IP hashes or sticky HTTP sessions are just another workarounds for keeping all that stuff working.
Another problem consists of packet storms, coming from clients trying to reconnect to the server after long polling broadcasts. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish valid long polling reconnections from DDoS attacks. All this makes pool architecture more complicated and harder to maintain, which is reflected in less reliable pool service and has a real impact on miners.
The solution for such issues is related to the previous point about driving load by the server and not by thousands of (sometimes) strangely implemented miners, who are aggressively trying to reach the server.
I originally designed Stratum protocol for lightweight Bitcoin client called Electrum. Later I found out that protocol requirements are quite similar to requirements for bitcoin mining, so I decided to reuse it as-is. Don't be confused by an esoteric protocol name, I tried to stick to standards as much as possible.
In a simplified manner, Stratum is a line-based protocol using plain TCP socket, with payload encoded as JSON-RPC messages. That's all. Client simply opens TCP socket and writes requests to the server in the form of JSON messages finished by the newline character \n. Every line received by the client is again a valid JSON-RPC fragment containing the response.
There are good reasons for such solution: it is very easy to implement and very easy to debug, because both sides are talking in human-readable format. The protocol is unlike many other solutions *easily extensible* without messing up the backwards compatibility. As a bonus, JSON is widely supported on all platforms and current miners already have JSON libraries included. So packing and unpacking of the message is really simple and convenient.
There's no HTTP overhead involved and there're no hacks like mining extension flags encoded in HTTP headers anymore. But the biggest improvement from HTTP-based getwork is the fact, that server can drive the load by itself, it can send broadcast messages to miners at any time without any long-polling workarounds, load balancing issues and packet storms.
This is probably the most innovative part of the new protocol. In contrary to current mining where only ntime and nonce can be iterated, Stratum mining protocol gives a power to miners to easily build unique coinbase transactions locally, so they'll be able to produce unique block headers locally. I recommend to iterate four bytes of extranonce, which gives the possibility to serve 18  mining rig from a single TCP connection. But it can be easily changed by the pool operator anytime.
Every bitcoin block contains so-called coinbase transaction which specify the bitcoin address for sending block reward. Fortunately there's a chance to modify this transaction without breaking anything. By changing coinbase transaction, merkle root will change and we will have unique block header to hash. Currently this (creating unique coinbase) happens on pool servers. So let's move it to miners!
* Custom text protocol is human readable and easy to debug, but not so easy to implement as it may look at first glance. We have to define a way how to pair request and response, because sequential processing of requests may be a bit tricky on some platforms (yes, now I'm referring Twisted framework which I used for pool implementation). We also have to define how to serialize various data types like lists or even mappings. JSON solve all this transparently for us.
* Custom binary protocol is the most compact form which can saves a lot of bandwith, especially while dealing with binary data involved in bitcoin mining. However writing (de)serializers *properly* may be a bit tricky. I wanted the protocol which is easy to implement. Fiddling with byte order and binary headers is not what I was looking for.
Getblocktemplate introduced in bitcoind 0.7 is a very progressive solution for delegating block creation from full bitcoin client to standalone, specialized software. Stratum mining server uses getblocktemplate mechanism under the hood. There are still some reasons why Stratum is, in my opinion, a better solution for pooled mining:
* Stratum scales much better for rising amount of processed Bitcoin transactions, because it transfers only merkle branch hashes, in the contrary to complete dump of server’s memory pool in getblocktemplate.
There's really only one reason why Stratum is worse than getblocktemplate solution at this time: miners cannot choose Bitcoin transactions on their own. In my experience 99% of real miners don’t care about transaction selection anyway, they just want the highest possible block reward. At this point they share the same interest with pool operator, so there’s no real reason to complicate mining protocol just for those 1% who want to create custom blocks for the pool.
Stratum protocol is based on JSON-RPC 2.0. In this chapter I expect that you're familiar with this protocol and you understand terms like "request", "response" and "notification". Please read JSON-RPC specification ( ) for more details.
For high level image of the Stratum protocol concept, please read Stratum protocol specification ( ) on Google docs. This document needs some care, but give you the basic examples how to connect to Stratum server.
Now let authorize some workers. You can authorize as many workers as you wish and at any time during the session. In this way, you can handle big basement of independent mining rigs just by one Stratum connection.
Small engineering note: There's a good reason why first job is not included directly in subscription response - miner will need to handle one response type in two different way; firstly as a subscription response and then as a standalone notification. Hook job processing just to JSON-RPC notification sounds a bit better to me.
* merkle_branch - List of hashes, will be used for calculation of merkle root. This is not a list of all transactions, it only contains prepared hashes of steps of merkle tree algorithm. Please read some materials ( ) for understanding how merkle trees calculation works. Unfortunately this example don't have any step hashes included, my bad!
* clean_jobs - When true, server indicates that submitting shares from previous jobs don't have a sense and such shares will be rejected. When this flag is set, miner should also drop all previous jobs, so job_ids can be eventually rotated.
Now miner received all data required to serialize coinbase transaction: Coinb1, Extranonce1, Extranonce2_size and Coinb2. Firstly we need to generate Extranonce2 (must be unique for given job_id!). Extranonce2_size tell us expected length of binary structure. Just be absolutely sure that your extranonce2 generator always produces extranonce2 with correct length! For example my pool implementation sets extranonce2_size=4, which mean this is valid Extranonce2 (in hex): 00000000.
For following calculations we have to produce double-sha256 hash of given coinbase. In following snippets I'm using Python, but I'm sure you'll understand the concept even if you're a rubyist! It is as simple as:
For all current getwork-compatible miners you can use Stratum mining proxy ( ) running locally on your mining computer. One mining proxy can handle (almost) unlimited number of connected workers, so running one proxy for all of your mining rigs is a way to go.----




http://blogs.forbes.com/timothylee/2011/08/07/the-bitcoin-crash/

It's now looking increasingly likely that the record-high price of $32 on June 8 represented the peak of a speculative bubble that is now slowly deflating. The interesting question is: where will the price decline stop?
Most assets have a "fundamental" value: the value that reflects the practical use to which that asset can be put. You can always live in a house regardless of what happens to the real estate market, so we can be confident that house prices won't fall to zero. Similarly, if the price of gold fell too much, people could always use it to make jewelry, so gold is a relatively safe investment.
The puzzling thing about Bitcoin, which I pointed out ( ) back in April, is that the currency doesn't seem to have any fundamental value at all. True, you can currently purchase a limited selection of goods and services with Bitcoins. But the volume of Bitcoin-denominated commerce is small enough that Bitcoin-denominated prices seem to be driven by the current value of Bitcoin rather than the other way around.
This is different from traditional currencies. The fact that there are 300 million Americans who use dollars for their day-to-day transactions creates a floor for the value of dollars. Most of us don't pay much attention to the exchange rate between dollars and other currencies, because we're used to thinking of dollars as our fundamental unit of value. And even if we wanted to stop using dollars, it would be hard to do since most of the people around us won't take anything else. So, barring a major screw-up by the Federal Reserve, we can count on the value of dollars not falling very much.
In contrast, there's no significant community of people who conduct commerce exclusively (or even primarily) in Bitcions. And you can't eat, live in, or make jewelry out of Bitcions. And this means there's no logical stopping point to Bitcoin's price decline. So far Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buying Bitcoins as the price falls, convinced that the price will go back up eventually. But as the hoped-for rally has failed to materialize, more have gotten discouraged or bored and cash out, pushing the price down further. This process has been going on for a couple of months, and now it appears to be accelerating. I suspect it's terminal.----




https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354554919_Bitcoin's_growing_e-waste_problem

Bitcoin’s increasing energy consumption has triggered a passionate debate about the sustainability of the digital currency. And yet, most studies have thus far ignored that Bitcoin miners cycle through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate the growth in global electronic waste. E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin’s e-waste and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons per annum, per May 2021. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to mitigate Bitcoin’s growing e-waste problem.
... The exodus is also impacting opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, for example in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where local people are outcompeted by bitcoin miners for access to cheap renewable energy [21]. As mining operations use vast amounts of highly specialised and short-lived hardware, obsolete equipment is likely to cause additional damage to the environment and human health, especially in developing areas where much of this hazardous electronic waste (e-waste) is disposed [22]. ...
... Bitcoin's global network of tailored ASIC units, more powerful than all the world's super-computers put together many times over, cannot be repurposed to do anything else, besides running the SHA-256 5 hash function used to mine a cryptocurrency that few will ever use, beyond short term speculation. Redundant units created around 30.7 kilotons of e-waste in 2021 [22] , much of which was disposed of in developing countries [27,28,22]. Identifying redundant ASIC units as waste is difficult, which causes enforcement challenges with regards to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (1992). ...

The rate of adoption of some cryptocurrencies is triggering alarm from energy researchers and social scientists concerned about the industry’s growing environmental and social impacts. In this paper we argue that the unsustainable trajectory of some cryptocurrencies disproportionately impacts poor and vulnerable communities where cryptocurrency producers and other actors take advantage of economic instabilities, weak regulations, and access to cheap energy and other resources. Globally, over 100 million people hold cryptocurrency, mostly as a speculative asset. The digital infrastructure behind the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, currently requires as much energy as the whole of Thailand, with a carbon footprint exceeding the gold mining industry. Should bitcoin’s mass adoption continue, an escalating climate crisis is inevitable, disproportionately exacerbating social and environmental challenges for communities already experiencing multiple dimensions of deprivation. In mitigating these impacts, the paper considers 4 potential regulatory pathways, including: 1) promoting voluntary private-sector commitments to using only renewable energy, 2) encouraging a system of voluntary carbon offsetting, 3) using existing financial regulations and tax frameworks, and 4) imposing national international bans on cryptocurrency ‘mining’. The paper argues that effective environmental regulation of cryptocurrencies is urgently required, both to reduce the threat of catastrophic climate change, and to help the world’s poorest towards sustainable development. However, regulating cryptocurrency mining in any context is likely to require a combination of efforts and is unlikely to result in win-win outcomes for all.
... We know from Stoll et al. [25] that bitcoin mining is using lots of energy and having a huge carbon footprint. de Vries et al. [27] found that bitcoin mining generates lots of hardware waste or e-waste. ...
... This new direction provides the groundwork for reversal of a global trend of energy waste. It is anticipated that this new direction can change the trend which is having a negative planetary wide impact [43], [45]. ...
This work introduces a novel approach for the governance of a blockchain containing social constructs and technical viability for widescale applications for the next generation of distributed ledgers. Functional requirements for this new blockchain distributed ledger (BDL) were garnered from an analysis of the needs for large-scale applications. Applied research was employed as part of this endeavor to test the practicality and scalability of the solution outline. Novel features in this application draw together controls and enforcement for cybersecurity, digital content management, licensing, and configuration management. The Synchronous Trust Consensus Model applied research project named Project Philos was sponsored by the BlockChain Development Community (BCDC) with support from the University of Colorado. Research has followed both theorized conceptual and theory-to-practice models to prove the scientific soundness and the viability of incentive for community engagement. Results show that this new model proves the feasibility of an indefinitely expandable blockchain distributed ledger capability, while also providing a new participant incentive that is highly effective in engaging a community of practitioners.
... Apart from energy consumption, electronic waste (E-waste) produced by mining is another major environmental concern. Mining encourages the use of performance-specific hardware, such as ASICs, which becomes obsolete in approximately every 1.5 years and contributes to, as of early 2021, the average e-waste generated by Bitcoin estimated at 64.4 metric kilotons per year [12]. Similar to electricity consumption, the E-waste generated by other altcoins also needs to be considered. ...
Following the footprints of Bitcoins, many other cryptocurrencies were developed mostly adopting the same or similar Proof-of-Work (PoW) approach. Since completing the PoW puzzle requires extremely high computing power, consuming a vast amount of electricity, PoW has been strongly criticised for its antithetic stand against the notion of green computing. Use of application-specific hardware, particularly application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) has further fuelled the debate, as these devices are of no use once they become “legacy” and hence obsolete to compete in the mining race, thus contributing to electronics waste. Therefore, this paper surveys the currently available alternative approaches to PoW and evaluates their applicability - especially their appropriateness in terms of greenness.
When bitcoin (BTC), the first pioneering cryptocurrency was released in 2009, it was considered an apolitical currency. Besides, the possible effect of BTC and other cryptocurrencies on either financial markets or transactions has been widely discussed. However, the environmental effects of cryptocurrency demand have been ignored. Here, this study examines the nexus between cryptocurrencies and environmental degradation by employing standard and asymmetric causality methods. The Toda-Yamamoto and bootstrap-augmented Toda-Yamamoto test results reveal Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) excluding Ripple (XRP) have causal effects on environmental degradation. The Fourier-augmented Toda-Yamamoto test results show causal effects running from Bitcoin and Ripple to environmental degradation, whereas no causal effect runs from Ethereum to environmental degradation. The asymmetric causality shows causal effects from the positive shock of Bitcoin demand, negative shocks of Ripple and Ethereum demands to positive shocks of environmental degradation. Further discussions and policy implications are provided in the relevant sections of this study.
Mexicali, a Mexican city located near the US-Mexico border, has faced several challenges related to adopting an integrated e-waste management system. Thus, the main objective of this work is to propose a new system to be implemented in phases. The current system is evaluated using several methodological approaches including field studies, surveys, interviews, and quantitative modeling via material flow analysis. We suggest the need to properly integrate both the formal and informal sectors to achieve the optimal system that mitigates environmental impacts while preserving the positive social and economic traits of the current system. Thus, without supplanting the current reuse, refurbishment, repair and maintenance practices, a hybrid system is proposed, based on a centralized facility that primarily handles those parts or materials that create environmental impacts and health hazards if mishandled. Furthermore, a decentralized transition phase toward the new system is recommended.
Electronic waste, or e-waste, is the fastest growing category of waste in developed countries and a threat to the environment and human health. The extension of electronic products life cycles could reduce the use of finite resources, the emission of pollutants, and the amount of waste disposed of in the landfills, delaying the impacts of disposal and product replacement. Consumers’ decisions affect the environmental impact of a product since deliberate consumer effort is necessary to extend and fully explore the potential life cycle of a product. The objective of this article is to investigate current consumer practices in the repair of electronic products. To achieve this goal, we analyze recently published research presenting surveys and case studies about the repair of electronic products. The literature review identified a range of barriers and motivations that influence the decision to repair. We also examined how institutional initiatives to address product reparability, such as governmental directives, are responding to consumer practices. Our results emphasize the need for an environment that promotes and enables more sustainable behaviors. We discuss the necessity to consider not only technical aspects but also intangible aspects in public perception, such as the role of perceived obsolescence in the search for a more circular economy.

It provides novel insights into the state of the cryptoasset industry, having gathered data from 280 companies in 59 countries and across four main market segments – exchanges, payments, custody and mining.
The Global E-waste Monitor 2020 provides the most comprehensive overview of the global e-waste challenge, explains how it fits into international efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goals, and discusses how to create a sustainable society and circular economy. The report provides a national and regional analysis on e-waste quantities and legislative instruments, and makes predictions until 2030. It also encourages decision-makers to increase activities to measure and monitor e-waste using an internationally recognised methodological framework. Visit for more information.
Bitcoin is a power-hungry cryptocurrency that is increasingly used as an investment and payment system. Here we show that projected Bitcoin usage, should it follow the rate of adoption of other broadly adopted technologies, could alone produce enough CO2 emissions to push warming above 2 °C within less than three decades.
The electrical efficiency of computation has doubled roughly every year and a half for more than six decades, a pace of change comparable to that for computer performance and electrical efficiency in the microprocessor era. These efficiency improvements enabled the creation of laptops, smart phones, wireless sensors, and other mobile computing devices, with many more such innovations yet to come. The Web Extra appendix outlines the data and methods used in this study.
In this paper the environmental problems related with the discarded electronic appliances, known as e-waste, are reviewed.Moreover, the current and the future production of e-waste, the potential environmental problems associated with theirdisposal and management practices are discussed whereas the existing e-waste management schemes in Greece and othercountries (Japan, Switzerland) are also quoted.
The digital currency Bitcoin is known for its energy hunger and associated carbon footprint. Investors, how-ever, must not neglect further environmental, social, and governance issues related to digital currencies. Therefore, we urge the adoption of a more comprehensive view in assessing the externalities of investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As the resource intensity of running Bitcoin has increased over recent years, it has become a serious concern for its potential impact on health and climate. Within this context, there exists a growing need for accurate information. Various organizations need this for multiple purposes like properly assessing the urgency of the problem, implementing the right policy response in the right locations and for setting up mitigation programs. We propose a market dynamics approach to evaluate the current methods for obtaining information on Bitcoin's energy demand. This allows us to establish that, while historically the Bitcoin mining industry has been growing most of the time, this growth allows market participants to pursue strategies that don't necessarily involve the best devices, device settings, or locations. The bigger the profitability of mining, the more it allows market participants to make decisions that result in suboptimal power efficiency of the Bitcoin network. Specifically, while the profitability of mining peaked during 2019, we find that market participants primarily used older generations of devices with better availability and lower acquisition costs. Common estimation approaches don't only fail to capture this behavior, but also fail to properly capture the market circumstances, like seasonal and geographic variation in electricity prices, that help enable participants to do so in the first place. This combination leaves common approaches prone to providing optimistic estimates during growth cycles. We conservatively estimate the Bitcoin network to consume 87.1 TWh of electrical energy annually per September 30, 2019 (equaling a country like Belgium).
Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.
In this paper we find that the Bitcoin network, with an electrical energy footprint of 491.4 to 765.4 kWh per transaction on average, is relatively much more energy-hungry than the traditional financial system. Even though it has been argued that renewable energy may help mitigating the environmental impact of this, we find that there exist fundamental challenges in uniting variable renewable energy production with the consistent demand of Bitcoin mining machines. Moreover, we find that the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining reaches beyond its energy use. Continuous increasing energy (cost) efficiency of newer iterations of mining devices ensures that older ones will inevitably be disposed on a regular basis. The resulting electronic waste generation could equal that of a small country like Luxembourg, with a staggering average footprint of four light bulbs worth of electronic waste per processed Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin will therefore have to address its sustainability problem in another way. This may consist of replacing its mining mechanism with a greener alternative like Proof-of-Stake.
Blockchain technology rapidly gained popularity based on its open and decentralized operation. Consensus protocol is the core mechanism of a blockchain network that securely maintains the distributed ledger from possible attacks from adversaries. Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a commonly used consensus protocol that requires a significant amount of computation to find a new valid block. As the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are specially designed for PoW computation begin to dominate blockchain consensus operation, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks is being threatened. Many PoW mechanisms are being proposed to disincentivize the use of ASICs in the consensus operation. Employing multiple hash functions in the PoW computation (i.e., multi-hash PoW) is one of the commonly adopted approaches to achieve such ASIC-resistance. In this work, we experimentally evaluate the level of ASIC-resistance of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms. We assess the level of ASIC-resistance based on the performance gap between ASICs and general-purpose computing platforms. Contrary to the expectation of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms, our results reveal that ASIC-resistance of these PoW mechanisms is not strong enough to prevent ASIC-based mining. Most of them show similar levels of ASIC-resistance as those of PoW mechanisms that are already defeated by ASIC-based systems.
Since its deployment in 2009, Bitcoin has achieved remarkable success and spawned hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. The author traces the evolution of the hardware underlying the system, from early GPU-based homebrew machines to today’s datacenters powered by application-specific integrated circuits. These ASIC clouds provide a glimpse into planet-scale computing’s future.
GPU- and FPGA-based clouds have been deployed to accelerate computationally intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a natural evolution as cloud services expand across the planet. ASIC Clouds are purpose-built datacenters comprising large arrays of ASIC accelerators that optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume scale-out computations. On the surface, ASIC Clouds may seem improbable due to high nonrecurring engineering (NRE) costs and ASIC inflexibility, but large-scale ASIC Clouds have been deployed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. This article distills lessons from these Bitcoin ASIC Clouds and applies them to other large-scale workloads, including YouTube-style video-transcoding and Deep Learning, showing superior TCO versus CPU and GPU. It derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud servers based on accelerator properties, by jointly optimizing ASIC architecture, DRAM, motherboard, power delivery, cooling, and operating voltage. Finally, the authors examine the impact of ASIC NRE and when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud.
As bitcoin becomes more important as a worldwide financial phenomenon, it also becomes important to understand its sources of value formation. There are three ways to obtain bitcoins: buy them outright, accept them in exchange, or else produce them by 'mining'. Mining employs computational effort which requires electrical consumption for operation. The cost of electricity per kWh, the efficiency of mining as measured by watts per unit of mining effort, the market price of bitcoin, and the difficulty of mining all matter in making the decision to produce. Bitcoin production seems to resemble a competitive market, so in theory miners will produce until their marginal costs equal their marginal product. Break-even points are modeled for market price, energy cost, efficiency and difficulty to produce. The cost of production price may represent a theoretical value around which market prices tend to gravitate. As the average efficiency increases over time due to competition driving technological progress – as inefficient capital becomes obsolete it is removed while new capital replaces them – the break-even production cost of bitcoins denominated in dollars will fall. Increased efficiency, although necessary to maintain competitive advantage over other miners could serve to drive the value of bitcoin down, however adjustments in the mining difficulty and the regular halving of the block reward throughout time will tend to counteract a decreasing tendency in cost of production.
Waste electrical and electronic equipment (or e-waste) is one of the fastest growing waste streams, which encompasses a wide and increasing spectrum of products. Accurate estimation of e-waste generation is difficult, mainly due to lack of high quality data referred to market and socio-economic dynamics. This paper addresses how to enhance e-waste estimates by providing techniques to increase data quality. An advanced, flexible and multivariate Input-Output Analysis (IOA) method is proposed. It links all three pillars in IOA (product sales, stock and lifespan profiles) to construct mathematical relationships between various data points. By applying this method, the data consolidation steps can generate more accurate time-series datasets from available data pool. This can consequently increase the reliability of e-waste estimates compared to the approach without data processing. A case study in the Netherlands is used to apply the advanced IOA model. As a result, for the first time ever, complete datasets of all three variables for estimating all types of e-waste have been obtained. The result of this study also demonstrates significant disparity between various estimation models, arising from the use of data under different conditions. It shows the importance of applying multivariate approach and multiple sources to improve data quality for modelling, specifically using appropriate time-varying lifespan parameters. Following the case study, a roadmap with a procedural guideline is provided to enhance e-waste estimation studies.
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Electrical and electronic waste commonly known as e-waste is now one of the world's major concerns. Industries have been so diligent and successful in recent years. The sales and trend of electronic goods have increased rapidly in the world. But with the increase in the manufacturing of electrical and electronic goods and their trend, the result has been somehow leading us to the concern of... [Show full abstract] e-waste. The obsolescence of electrical and electronics goods has become a huge drawback in the field technology because it is measured that various techniques have been used to solve this issue regarding the e-waste produced by industries but none of the solutions to recycle was very effective in the favors of nature and biodiversity. This research paper aims to particularize highlight and determine, the major concern, the effect of e-waste on environment and health.
The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these... [Show full abstract] calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.
Phenols are among the most common contaminants which enter a water objects with a sewage from various enterprises: oil refineries, coke-chemical, wood-chemical, aniline dyes, etc. Phenols are very toxic compounds. They can cause not only poisoning of organisms, but also significantly change the regime of biogenic elements and gases dissolved in water and first of all oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Disease states in experimental animals are usually accompanied by biochemical alterations. Thus a good working knowledge of reference values of some biochemical constituent of the haemolymph of snails (Archachatina marginata) is needed as reference point for future researchers on snail. It is also necessary to determine whether these values could be influenced by diets. Thirty six experimental... [Show full abstract] snails of mean weight of 125.64±2.35g were randomly distributed into 4 dietary treatments of Pawpaw Leaves (PL), Whole Lettuce (WL), Lettuce Wastes (LW) and Cabbage Wastes (CW). Nine snails were used as control animals to determine the reference values. They were fed ad libitum for 60 days. Parameters determined were, proximate composition, mineral profile, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase. There was significant (p<0.05) reduction in crude protein of haemolymph from 24.14 to 21.20% for snails fed LW. The increase in ash from 0.79 to 0.84 in snails fed LW was significant. There were significant increases in all the minerals analyzed in all the treatment groups with Calcium recording the highest concentration of 170 There was also significant (p<0.05) decrease in albumin and albumin:globulin when snails were fed the experimental diets. Values obtained for the enzymes, ALT and AST between treatments were similar. The study established that the feedstuffs were safe for their consumption and could not lead to any tissue damage. Values of 165 for AST, 11 for ALT, total protein, 7.1 globulin, 3.9 albumin, 3.2 and albumin:globulin, 0.82 could serve as reference values.----




https://decrypt.co/43848/why-bitcoin-miners-dont-use-more-renewable-energy

Though 76% of proof-of-work miners say they use renewable energy as part of their fuel mix, renewables comprise just 39% of the total energy consumption of the world’s cryptocurrency miners, according to a survey ( ) by Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance, published late last month.
To mine cryptocurrency, computers race to solve complex computational puzzles. Since brute force is the only way of solving these puzzles, only the most powerful—and therefore most power-hungry—computers make a profit.
The Cambridge’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimates that Bitcoin miners use a 7.55 gigawatts ( ) worth of electricity a year. An alternative metric ( ) produced by Digiconomist ( ) estimates that Bitcoin mining ( ) produces a carbon footprint comparable to that produced by Denmark, and an energy consumption that rivals Colombia’s.
From a pool of 280 major crypto companies in 59 countries, Cambridge’s survey shows that 62% of mining companies said they used hydroelectric power to power cryptocurrency miners; 17% said they used wind; 15% used solar and 8% incorporated geothermal power.
However, the survey also shows that of the total energy consumed for cryptocurrency mining, only 39% comes from renewable energy sources. The other 61% comes from non-renewable energy, such as fossil fuels like coal.
According to Cambridge’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), the Asia-Pacific region produces 77% of Bitcoin’s hashpower. And according to the survey, 65% of hashers from that region said they relied equally on hydroelectricity and coal.
This is because Chinese mining companies rely on cheap hydroelectric power in the wet season of Sichuan province, then up sticks once the dry season starts in October and relocate to colder provinces, like Xinjiang, where they rely on fossil fuels but scrimp on cooling costs.
Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist and creator of the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ( ) , told Decrypt , “Bitcoin miners would probably love to have access to cheap excesses of renewables like this throughout the whole year, but the reality is that those excesses simply aren't there outside the summer period.”
De Vries said that climate change could make the cheap hydroelectric power of Sichuan less attractive to miners, since shifting rainfall patterns, draughts and floods ( ) make it difficult to get a steady supply of cheap electricity.
“Bitcoin mining is a operation, all year long. They require both cheap AND consistent energy. You're simply not going to get that from renewable energy sources alone,” he said. In places like Kazakhstan and Iran, which offer cheap fossil fuels, “miners can obtain cheap energy all year round.”
A chart from Digiconomist illustrates this point. Miner competition and cost efficiency has made Bitcoin mining less “green” over time. Unless less energy-intensive mining algorithms are developed or breakthroughs in renewable energy discovered, the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining will only get worse.----

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Network upgrades are discussed separately in the Ethereum Project Management ( ) repository.
* *Last Call* - This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL. An EIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the EIP to Review.
* *Withdrawn* - The EIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed EIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this EIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.
Describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum. Furthermore Standard EIPs can be broken down into the following categories.
Improvements requiring a consensus fork (e.g. EIP-5 ( ) , EIP-101 ( ) ), as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions (for example, the strategy changes 2, 3, and 4 of EIP-86 ( ) ).
Includes improvements around client specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names ( EIP-6 ( ) ) and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an EIP is submitted to the EIPs repository.
Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards ( ERC-20 ( ) ), name registries ( ERC-137 ( ) ), URI schemes ( ERC-681 ( ) ), formats ( EIP190 ( ) ), and wallet formats ( EIP-85 ( ) ).
Describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process EIPs are like Standards Track EIPs but apply to areas other than the Ethereum protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational EIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum development. Any meta-EIP is also considered a Process EIP.
Describes a Ethereum design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational EIPs do not necessarily represent Ethereum community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational EIPs or follow their advice.----

https://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ether.html

Ethereum has a metric system of denominations used as units of ether. Each denomination has its own unique name (some bear the family name of seminal figures playing a role in evolution of computer science and cryptoeconomics). The smallest denomination aka base unit of ether is called Wei. Below is a list of the named denominations and their value in Wei. Following a common (although somewhat ambiguous) pattern, ether also designates a unit (of 1e18 or one quintillion Wei) of the currency. Note that the currency is not called Ethereum as many mistakenly think, nor is Ethereum a unit.
Note that the Ethereum platform is special in that the smart contracts enable trustless services that obviate the need for trusted third parties in a currency exchange transaction, ie. disintermediate currency exchange businesses.
Ethereum is unique in the realm of cryptocurrencies in that ether has utility value as a cryptofuel, commonly referred to as “gas”. Beyond transaction fees, gas is a central part of every network request and requires the sender to pay for the computing resources consumed. The gas cost is dynamically calculated, based on the volume and complexity of the request and multiplied by the current gas price. Its value as a cryptofuel has the effect of increasing the stability and long-term demand for ether and Ethereum as a whole. For more information, see Account Types, Gas, and Transactions ( ).
Gas has multiple associated terms with it: Gas Prices, Gas Cost, Gas Limit, and Gas Fees. The principle behind Gas is to have a stable value for how much a transaction or computation costs on the Ethereum network.
* Gas Limit is the maximum amount of Gas that can be used per block, it is considered the maximum computational load, transaction volume, or block size of a block, and miners can slowly change this value over time.
* Gas Fee is effectively the amount of Gas needed to be paid to run a particular transaction or program (called a contract). The Gas Fees of a block can be used to imply the computational load, transaction volume, or size of a block. The gas fees are paid to the miners (or bonded contractors in PoS).----

MIMBLEWIMBLE Tom Elvis Jedusor 19 July, 2016 Introduction Bitcoin is the first widely used financial system for which all the necessary data to validate the system status can be cryptographically verified by anyone. However, it accomplishes this feat by storing all transactions in a public database called "the blockchain" and someone who genuinely wishes to check this state must download the whole thing and basically replay each transaction, check each one as they go. Meanwhile, most of these transactions have not affected the actual final state (they create outputs that are destroyed a transaction later). At the time of this writing, there were nearly 150 million transactions committed in the blockchain, which must be replayed to produce a set of only 4 million unspent outputs. It would be better if an auditor needed only to check data on the outputs themselves, but this is impossible because they are valid if and only if the output is at the end of a chain of previous outputs, each signs the next. In other words, the whole blockchain must be validated to confirm the final state. Add to this that these transactions are cryptographically atomic, it is clear what outputs go into every transaction and what emerges. The "transaction graph" resulting reveals a lot of information and is subjected to analysis by many companies whose business model is to monitor and control the lower classes. This makes it very non-private and even dangerous for people to use. Some solutions to this have been proposed. Greg Maxwell discovered to encrypt the amounts, so that the graph of the transaction is faceless but still allow validation that the sums are correct [1]. Dr Maxwell also produced CoinJoin, a system for Bitcoin users to combine interactively transactions, confusing the transaction graph. Nicolas van Saberhagen has developed a system to blind the transaction entries, goes much further to cloud the transaction graph (as well as not needed the user interaction) [3]. Later, Shen Noether combined the two approaches to obtain "confidential transactions" of Maxwell AND the darkening of van Saberhagen [4]. These solutions are very good and would make Bitcoin very safe to use. But the problem of too much data is made even worse. Confidential transactions require multi-kilobyte proofs on every output, and van Saberhagen signatures require every output to be stored for ever, since it is not possible to tell when they are truly spent. Dr. Maxwell's CoinJoin has the problem of needing interactivity. Dr. Yuan Horas Mouton fixed this by making transactions freely mergeable [5], but he needed to use pairing-based cryptography, which is potentially slower and more difficult to trust. He called this "one-way aggregate signatures" (OWAS). OWAS had the good idea to combine the transactions in blocks. Imagine that we can combine across blocks (perhaps with some glue data) so that when the outputs are created and destroyed, it is the same as if they never existed. Then, to validate the entire chain, users only need to know when money is entered into the system (new money in each block as in Bitcoin or Monero or peg-ins for sidechains [6]) and final unspent outputs, the rest can be removed and forgotten. Then we can have Confidential Transactions to hide the amounts and OWAS to blur the transaction graph, and use LESS space than Bitcoin to allow users to fully verify the blockchain. And also imagine that we must not pairing-based cryptography or new hypotheses, just regular discrete logarithms signatures like Bitcoin. Here is what I propose. I call my creation Mimblewimble because it is used to prevent the blockchain from talking about all user's information [7]. Confidential Transactions and OWAS The first thing we need to do is remove Bitcoin Script. This is sad, but it is too powerful so it is impossible to merge transactions using general scripts. We will demonstrate that confidential transactions of Dr. Maxwell are enough (after some small modification) to authorize spending of outputs and also allows to make combined transactions without interaction. This is in fact identical to OWAS, and allows relaying nodes take some transaction fee or the recipient to change the transaction fees. These additional things Bitcoin can not do, we get for free. We start by reminding the reader how confidential transactions work. First, the amounts are coded by the following equation: C = r*G + v*H where C is a Pedersen commitment, G and H are fixed nothing-up-my-sleeve elliptic curve group generators, v is the amount, and r is a secret random blinding key. Attached to this output is a rangeproof which proves that v is in [0, 2^64], so that user cannot exploit the blinding to produce overflow attacks, etc. To validate a transaction, the verifer will add commitments for all outputs, plus f*H (f here is the transaction fee which is given explicitly) and subtracts all input commitments. The result must be 0, which proves that no amount was created or destroyed overall. We note that to create such a transaction, the user must know the sum of all the values of r for commitments entries. Therefore, the r-values (and their sums) act as secret keys. If we can make the r output values known only to the recipient, then we have an authentication system! Unfortunately, if we keep the rule that commits all add to 0, this is impossible, because the sender knows the sum of all _his_ r values, and therefore knows the receipient's r values sum to the negative of that. So instead, we allow the transaction to sum to a nonzero value k*G, and require a signature of an empty string with this as key, to prove its amount component is zero. We let transactions have as many k*G values as they want, each with a signature, and sum them during verification. To create transactions sender and recipient do following ritual: 1. Sender and recipient agree on amount to be sent. Call this b. 2. Sender creates transaction with all inputs and change output(s), and gives recipient the total blinding factor (r-value of change minus r-values of inputs) along with this transaction. So the commitments sum to r*G - b*H. 3. Recipient chooses random r-values for his outputs, and values that sum to b minus fee, and adds these to transaction (including range proof). Now the commitments sum to k*G - fee*H for some k that only recipient knows. 4. Recipient attaches signature with k to the transaction, and the explicit fee. It has done. Now, creating transactions in this manner supports OWAS already. To show this, suppose we have two transactions that have a surplus k1*G and k2*G, and the attached signatures with these. Then you can combine the lists of inputs and outputs of the two transactions, with both k1*G and k2*G to the mix, and voilá! is again a valid transaction. From the combination, it is impossible to say which outputs or inputs are from which original transaction. Because of this, we change our block format from Bitcoin to this information: 1. Explicit amounts for new money (block subsidy or sidechain peg-ins) with whatever else data this needs. For a sidechain peg-in maybe it references a Bitcoin transaction that commits to a specific excess k*G value? 2. Inputs of all transactions 3. Outputs of all transactions 4. Excess k*G values for all transactions Each of these are grouped together because it do not matter what the transaction boundaries are originally. In addition, Lists 2 3 and 4 should be required to be coded in alphabetical order, since it is quick to check and prevents the block creator of leaking any information about the original transactions. Note that the outputs are now identified by their hash, and not by their position in a transaction that could easily change. Therefore, it should be banned to have two unspent outputs are equal at the same time, to avoid confusion. Merging Transactions Across Blocks Now, we have used Dr. Maxwell's Confidential Transactions to create a noninteractive version of Dr. Maxwell's CoinJoin, but we have not seen the last of marvelous Dr. Maxwell! We need another idea, transaction cut-through, he described in [8]. Again, we create a noninteractive version of this, and to show how it is used with several blocks. We can imagine now each block as one large transaction. To validate it, we add all the output commitments together, then subtracts all input commitments, k*G values, and all explicit input amounts times H. We find that we could combine transactions from two blocks, as we combined transactions to form a single block, and the result is again a valid transaction. Except now, some output commitments have an input commitment exactly equal to it, where the first block's output was spent in the second block. We could remove both commitments and still have a valid transaction. In fact, there is not even need to check the rangeproof of the deleted output. The extension of this idea all the way from the genesis block to the latest block, we see that EVERY nonexplicit input is deleted along with its referenced output. What remains are only the unspent outputs, explicit input amounts and every k*G value. And this whole mess can be validated as if it were one transaction: add all unspent commitments output, subtract the values k*G, validate explicit input amounts (if there is anything to validate) then subtract them times H. If the sum is 0, the entire chain is good. What is this mean? When a user starts up and downloads the chain he needs the following data from each block: 1. Explicit amounts for new money (block subsidy or sidechain peg-ins) with whatever else data this needs. 2. Unspent outputs of all transactions, along with a merkle proof that each output appeared in the original block. 3. Excess k*G values for all transactions. Bitcoin today there are about 423000 blocks, totaling 80GB or so of data on the hard drive to validate everything. These data are about 150 million transactions and 5 million unspent nonconfidential outputs. Estimate how much space the number of transactions take on a Mimblewimble chain. Each unspent output is around 3Kb for rangeproof and Merkle proof. Each transaction also adds about 100 bytes: a k*G value and a signature. The block headers and explicit amounts are negligible. Add this together and get 30Gb -- with a confidential transaction and obscured transaction graph! Questions and Intuition Here are some questions that since these weeks, dreams asked me and I woke up sweating. But in fact it is OK. Q. If you delete the transaction outputs, user cannot verify the rangeproof and maybe a negative amount is created. A. This is OK. For the entire transaction to validate all negative amounts must have been destroyed. User have SPV security only that no illegal inflation happened in the past, but the user knows that _at this time_ no inflation occurred. Q. If you delete the inputs, double spending can happen. A. In fact, this means: maybe someone claims that some unspent output was spent in the old days. But this is impossible, otherwise the sum of the combined transaction could not be zero. An exception is that if the outputs are amount zero, it is possible to make two that are negatives of each other, and the pair can be revived without anything breaks. So to prevent consensus problems, outputs 0-amount should be banned. Just add H at each output, now they all amount to at least 1. Future Research Here are some questions I can not answer at the time of this writing. 1. What script support is possible? We would need to translate script operations into some sort of discrete logarithm information. 2. We require user to check all k*G values, when in fact all that is needed is that their sum is of the form k*G. Instead of using signatures is there another proof of discrete logarithm that could be combined? 3. There is a denial-of-service option when a user downloads the chain, the peer can give gigabytes of data and list the wrong unspent outputs. The user will see that the result do not add up to 0, but cannot tell where the problem is. For now maybe the user should just download the blockchain from a Torrent or something where the data is shared between many users and is reasonably likely to be correct.

http://blog.kraken.com/post/155126375697/kraken-launches-monero-trading

Today Kraken is launching support for trading Monero (XMR). Monero is one of the leading cryptocurrencies that has seen huge 40x market cap growth in 2016 and trades with high volume and liquidity. Monero is built on the core principles of privacy, decentralization, open development, scaleability, and fungibility.
To deposit your XMR go to Funding > Deposit > XMR and generate a deposit address. Then send your XMR deposit to this deposit address. *15 confirmations are required* before the funds are available in your account balance for trading. Kraken utilizes integrated addresses which have the payment ID embedded in the address, so you don’t need to specify a separate payment ID for your deposit.
There is a hard fork planned for block 1220516 ( ) , estimated for January 9th or 10th (an upgrade to enable RingCT ( ) transactions). Note that you should upgrade to Monero v0.10.1 ( ) before the hard fork. The hard fork is expected to go smoothly, but there may be significant price volatility around the event presenting opportunity for traders. Kraken XMR deposits will go offline shortly before the fork and remain offline for several hours after the fork.
Based in San Francisco, Kraken is the world’s largest global digital asset exchange based on euro volume and liquidity. Kraken’s global client base trades over 90 digital assets and 7 different fiat currencies, including GBP, EUR, USD, CAD, JPY, CHF and AUD.
Founded in 2011, Kraken was the first U.S. crypto firm to receive a state-chartered banking license, as well as one of the first exchanges to offer spot trading with margin, regulated derivatives and index services. Kraken is trusted by millions of traders, institutions and authorities around the world and offers professional, around the clock online support.
Kraken is backed by investors including Tribe Capital, Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group, among others. For more information about Kraken, please visit www.kraken.com ( ).----

Media in general needs to be more responsible about what they report about cryptocurrencies. The publications we have mentioned above are highly trustworthy news outlets; people take them seriously. Most new investors will sell their holdings, causing the value of the currency to crash. This is especially true for Bitcoin due to its rising popularity, and India accounts for a 10th of all Bitcoin transactions.
Dear media houses, the US dollar is also not a legal tender in India. Does that make the currency Illegal? If you took five minutes to listen to what Mr Jaitley said again, you would have heard that he said: “eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system”. Are we asking for too much?
Hitesh Malviya is the Founder of ItsBlockchain. He is one of the most early adopters of blockchain & cryptocurrency enthusiast in India. After being into space for a few years, he started IBC in 2016 to help other early adopters learn about the technology.

http://timothyblee.com/2011/04/18/the-bitcoin-bubble/

My friend Jerry Brito is one of the best-connected and most insightful observers of the Internet I know, so when he starts talking up an Internet trend ( ) , I pay attention. ( ) But after reading his case ( ) for Bitcoin, a new digital currency, I remain a skeptic.
It’s an intriguing concept, but the fundamental question about any currency is whether its value will be stable over time. I’ll discuss why this seems dubious in a series of two posts. Today I’ll focus on the demand side; tomorrow I’ll consider claims that the supply of Bitcoins will be more stable than traditional currencies.
The fundamental demand-side problem is that it’s not clear why anyone would want Bitcoins—which are, after all, just entries in a database—in the first place. The obvious retort is that the same objection could be made of any fiat money system. The value of a fiat currency like the dollar is a matter of social convention: it’s valuable to me because other people will accept it as payment for stuff I want to buy. Theoretically, if you persuaded everyone that dollars were worthless, this would become a self-fulfilling prophesy. Conversely (the argument goes) all we have to do to make Bitcoins a “real” currency is to persuade some people that it’s valuable. And apparently, the creators of Bitoin have already succeeded ( ) in this task.
But dollars have at least two advantages over Bitcoins. The obvious difference is that the United States government requires taxes to be paid in US dollars. Since federal taxes represent a significant fraction of most peoples’ income, they will continue to demand dollars even if they prefer another currency for day-to-day transactions.
The more subtle difference has to do with network effects and transaction costs. Dollars underpin the American economy in essentially the same way that the protocol underpins the Internet. The original choice of a medium of exchange was arbitrary, but people needed to pick something and once the dollar was chosen it acquired tremendous momentum. Convincing Americans to switch to a currency other than the dollar is roughly as futile as convincing the Internet to switch to a protocol other than and for the same reasons.
First, people have made tremendous investment—emotional, financial, and technological—in dollars. Millions of vending machines and cash registers are designed to work with dollar-denominated coins and bills. People expect to see dollar-denominated prices in stores, and they have an intuitive sense for what’s a reasonable dollar-denominated price for a gallon of gas or a dozen eggs. They have dollar-denominated bank accounts, get dollar-denominated paychecks, and expect to retire on dollar-denominated pensions. It’s really hard to persuade Americans to use something else.
Second, currencies are subject to massive network effects. ( ) It’s much more convenient to carry a currency that 99.9 percent of people accept than the currency that 0.1 percent will take. People who hold obscure currencies have to waste time and money converting it to a more popular currency before they can perform everyday transactions. And people who conduct business in multiple currencies not only have to perform a lot of extra math, they also have to worry about exchange rate risk—the risk that a change in exchange rate will suddenly make a previously profitable business model suddenly unprofitable.
( ) Together these factors make the demand for dollars “sticky.” It’s hard to see any analogous stickiness in the demand for Bitcoins. As far as I can tell, there are few, if any, markets where Bitcoin transactions are more convenient than traditional fiat currency transactions. I’ve read some claims that Bitcoin is popular in the drug trade and other illicit markets, where the lack of intermediaries has obvious advantages. It’s hard to judge whether these claims are true, or whether such markets are substantial enough to support a new global currency, but I have my doubts.
Illicit uses aside, the demand for Bitcoins seems to be driven by a combination of speculation and ideological enthusiasm. And we have a word for an asset whose value is driven by irrational exuberance: a bubble. I predict this one will pop once the novelty wears off.
I can think of a scenario where some crazy person will want to buy up ALL THEEE BITCOINS (especially if the bubble bursts, and they become cheap enough to afford to own all of them) and will be willing to pay real world money for them.
Why are collector’s items valuable at all? Why is gold valuable at all? Is it REALLY because of it’s beauty? I tend to believe that it is because of it’s rarity. And eventually, provided that the network remains operational, Bitcoins will become a scarce commodity.
There is big opportunity to support bitcoin development. The currency is there now that transaction process have to be designed and easy for the masses to build. BitCoin does not have this. Remember economies jumping up all over gold mining is the US? It wasn’t just Gold Mining that Burst up. Shuvle, cart, railroads, and other business in these production fields prospered as well.
This is a totally US-centric view. The relevance of America and its dollar is waning. In the growing parts of the world, Bitcoin is a very good fit for how people bank and spend. For example, is some parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, up to 80% of payments are by cellphone rather than by colored paper. The author needs to get out more often.
“First, people have made tremendous investment—emotional, financial, and technological—in dollars. Millions of vending machines and cash registers are designed to work with dollar-denominated coins and bills. People expect to see dollar-denominated prices in stores, and they have an intuitive sense for what’s a reasonable dollar-denominated price for a gallon of gas or a dozen eggs. They have dollar-denominated bank accounts, get dollar-denominated paychecks, and expect to retire on dollar-denominated pensions. It’s really hard to persuade Americans to use something else.”
This totally fails to look beyond the borders of the US or the time you live in. Currencies have changed many times before, and a Europe-wide change from national currencies to the Euro is a comprable change in very recent history. I’m not making that as an argument that bitcoin could be adopted as a national currency in the US, but it’s certainly a short sighted and incredible argument against it.
I have to disagree with your analysis because you almost entierly leave out the unique properties of Bitcoins. Sure if someone made some new currency similar to dollars which existed in coins and paper, who would care for it? In those cases, your point about network effect etc is perfectly valid.
Here is why I think Bitcoins has a future. When I lived in Holland I used to eletronic cash found on cards called Chipknip. I loved it. It was very practical to use since there was no fees for transactions, no PIN code etc. A downside of them was that unlike real cash I could not easily exchange it with friends. I could not check my current balance without going to a special machine. There is no way to get to the money on the card if you are abroad. Bitcoin solves a lot of these problems: you can keep them on a phone and check your balance at any time. You can exchange them with anybody you meet on the street, and in principle they work in any country. I think people will assign real value to bitcoins because of their unique properties. After all gold gets value for much the same reasons. If it was only for its industrial and decorative uses I do not think it would be that valuable.
Let us not forget shady businesses such as adult entertainment, drugs etc, which will find the currency very attractive. For them it will be too usefull to give up on. This will create a floor for how far down the value can fall.
Just came in via Business Insider link and thought that some updates on the facts would be in order. BTC wallets have a couple of advantages over national currencies not addressed to date in the commentary:
2. BTC are a good alt currency to keep some of your emergency cash in. At a time when every major currency seems to be engaging in competitive devaluation, BTC will not be moving along with the herd over the monetary devaluation cliff.----




http://sebfor.com/myetherwallet-chrome-extension-release/

At first, understanding Ethereum is like trying to understand Einstein’s General Relativity. Watch youtube clips of Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, for too long and your head might explode.  The concepts are so new and so often counter-intuitive, it’s hard to define them simply.  Blockchains, distributed decentralized applications (Dapps), or smart contracts all have one thing in common: complexity. Even professional coders and financial professionals sometimes struggle to grasp the utility of Ethereum.  The fact is, much of Ethereum’s potential and uses have yet to be conceived.
Myetherwallet aims to simplify all of that for the average user.  Before Myetherewallet, owning Ether meant using command-line programs like Geth and Eth to send and receive transactions.  Except for Linux users, learning to use the command-line is like teaching your great-grandmother to use an iPhone.  While some people prefer to use the daunting black-box of code, most users don’t have the time or the interest to learn a new, unintuitive interface.  According to a recent reddit post by the MyEtherWallet creators, “ [MyEtherWallet] has been used successfully (by more people than [they] ever imagined) to transfer Ether, print paper wallets, move funds from exchanges into cold storage, and more.”
With Myetherwallet the process of creating a wallet is easy.  Simply type a minimum 7 character password and your wallet is generated in JSON, private key, and QR code form. Sending ETH is just as simple. Most importantly, the code is all client side. None of the data that is created by MyEtherWallet is stored on their servers.
The importance of cold-storage‒storing Ether locally on a computer or on paper‒can not be understated.  Storing cryptocurrencies on exchanges like Poloniex or Kraken, or using other online based wallet services, is fundamentally counter to the inherent safety of decentralized currencies. By keeping your wallet secure and local, you are in full control of your funds. While reputable exchanges can seem secure, they do not have the inherent security of the blockchain, and who knows how good their auditing and cyber defenses really are.
Yesterday, MyEtherWallet released a Chrome browser extension that makes Ether handling seamless and secure.  The extension stores and encrypts your wallet just like it stores any passwords or data you may already have on Chrome.  They are relatively certain the system is secure, but they do warn that the client is still in “beta” stages and could have bugs. In particular, they warn not to put more Ether in than you are willing to lose until they release a 100% stable version.
MyEtherWallet brings a timely web-based tool to the massive migration of people to the Ethereum network and cryptocurrency.  At the time of this writing, ETH has risen 30% surpassing DASH at 4.14 USD.  Ether is now the most valuable cryptocurrency second only to Bitcoin and there are no signs of it slowing down.
Mist, Ethereum’s proprietary wallet client, is still encountering issues in its fledgling stages. The client is reliant on the command-line program Geth and is not as polished as it needs to be.  Beyond being a wallet, Mist actually processes blocks in the Ether network and can provide statistics such as ‘gas’ fees used in transactions, allow you to send data with your ETH, and aid in setting up smart contracts. Unlike MyEtherWallet, Mist is aimed at developers and coders who want to use Ether in association with Dapps on the blockchain.
Another wallet to watch, that works similar to MyEtherWallet, is EthereumWallet.com.  EthereumWallet cleverly generates a random Ether address using user mouse inputs on the screen.  It offers a clean interface that allows you to download your JSON, QR code, or simply write down your address. EthereumWallet also supports transactions, but is still completely in beta and isn’t necessarily ready to handle your life savings.
If Ethereum continues to gain traction like it has in the last few weeks, it’s entirely possible the MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension will be the most handy extension around for Ether transactions. Until then, be cautious about the reliability of these services and make sure to fact check and do research on any wallet before using it.  Even while these wallets are aesthetically pleasing, carelessly losing money can be just a few keystrokes away if you fail to verify your addresses.  Luckily, services like MyEtherWallet and Mist do well to prevent major mistakes, but the most important thing for newcomers to remember is that there is no “undo” button on the blockchain.----




http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1239/what-is-the-recommended-way-to-safely-store-ether

Stack Exchange network consists of 178 Q&A communities including Stack Overflow ( ) , the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.
@JackWinters: I think it's close to being criminal that people consider that a website is an acceptable way to create a paper wallet. For all we know, even if the site looks fair, one time out of 50 it may decide to send a backdoored version to the user. The website could also be hacked and serve a backdoored version to anyone visiting the site during the compromise timeframe, etc. There are secure ways to create paper wallets. Using a website ain't one of them.
A lot has changed since I first asked this question so we probably need some updated answers and some meta discussion. e.g. Should the accepted answer be a community wiki. (This would make it more live but it could also potentially introduce additional security risks since someone could edit the wiki to link to malware or to include deliberate bad advice)
I recommend that people use whatever tool they can understand best and use with confidence. I do NOT believe that recommending someone who has never used command line to use geth. There's too much room for error and it deters people from investing and getting involved.
Regardless of what tool you use to create an you should always safely store all of the necessary information in multiple places. Multiple places means multiple physical locations. If your house burns down, that computer and piece of paper are both gone. Read the instructions. Ask questions.
There's no official recommendation, but the go-ethereum team (behind geth) is committed to ensuring keys created by it will be supported in future versions. The keystore used by geth has strong passphrase encryption and has been through a couple security audits.
* Cons: Slow to sync (have to load the whole chain), sometime slow or freezing when contracts have a high update rate (The DAO during first weeks is a good example), not easy to understand how it works, non mobile computer only (Windows, Linux, Mac).
@eth why did you merge my answer to this question ? I don't think is answers to the question as I'm not providing any information about storage safety. This was just a list of three different wallet types that have good reputation. If I answered about a secure way to store ether I would have focused on cold paper wallet, fire and water proof safes, multisig wallet contracts, encrypted usb keys and airgapped computers.
It's very easy to create backup account files in Mist. In the 'Accounts' section click 'Add Account'. Pick a strong yet easy-to-remember password (remember there is no password recovery option), confirm it, and your account is created. Create at least 2 accounts. Then click 'Backup' in the top menu. Choose the 'keystore' folder, opposite-click on it choose 'copy' (do NOT choose 'cut', that would be very bad). Navigate to your desktop, opposite-click in a blank area and choose 'paste'.
Now that you have copied your account keys, you can back them up. You may want to rename this new copy of the 'keystore' folder to something like 'Ethereum-keystore-backup-year-month-day' so you have quick recognition of it later. At this point you can then add the folder contents to a zip rar file (and even password-protect the archive with another strong yet easy-to-remember password if backing up online), copy it to a USB Drive, burn it to a CD DVD, or upload it to online storage (Dropbox Google Drive etc).
You now need to add approximately no less than 0.02 ETH to your primary account (the account you will initiate creation of a multisig wallet with). This is required for the transaction fee when you create the multisig wallet contract.
You will be entering the full addresses of all the accounts you are attaching to this multisig wallet, when you create it. I recommend copying pasting each address into a plain text editor (notepad kedit etc), after going to each account's details page in Mist, and choosing 'copy address' from the right-side column of buttons.
We are now ready to create the multisig wallet. Under 'Wallet Contracts', select 'Add Wallet Contract'. Give it a name, select the primary account owner, and choose 'Multisignature Wallet Contract'. You will see something like this appear:
Set whatever amount of owners (accounts) you are attaching to this multisig wallet, whatever you want for a daily withdrawal limit (that only requires one account to withdrawal that amount), and how many owners (accounts) are required to approve any withdrawal amount over the daily limit.
Now add the addresses of the accounts that you copied pasted into your text editor earlier, confirm all your settings are correct, and click 'Create' at the bottom. You will then need to enter your password to send the transaction. In the 'Wallet Contracts' section it should show your new wallet, and say 'creating'.
When wallet creation is complete, you should see your contract address on the screen. Select the entire address, copy paste it into a new text file in your text editor, and save the text file to your desktop as 'Ethereum-Wallet-Address.txt', or whatever you want to name it.
Now all you need to do is backup the 'Ethereum-Wallet-Address.txt' file the same way you backed up your account files, and then you are ready to load your new multisig wallet with ETH using this address.
If you are restoring from backup, simply copy the files inside the 'Ethereum-keystore-backup' folder over into the 'keystore' folder mentioned in the first section. FYI, you may need to create the 'keystore' folder if it's a brand new install of Mist on a machine it was never installed on before (the first time you create an account is when this folder is created). As for restoring a multisig wallet, instead of choosing 'Multisignature Wallet Contract' like we did before when creating it, we merely choose 'Import Wallet' instead.
2) Mist starts after syncing, but is a blank white screen. Chances are you are running the "xorg" video drivers on a Linux-based OS (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc). Try installing the manufacturer's video driver instead, here is a guide for Ubuntu-based OSes ( ).
3) "Wrong password" notice. This seems to be a false notice on ocassion, related possibly to syncing with peer nodes or something. I have encountered this one myself once. I restarted Mist and the problem went away.
I agree with Mist multisig. One feature that is nice about this is you can create a contract wallet with 2 account owners and set a small daily limit. Then leave one account in your keystore on your computer and take the other account and store it off-line. That way if there is ever a compromise they cant empty your contract but can only take the daily limit. If you want to remove more than the daily limit you have to approve with the other account (but can you do this on a different computer). Obviously, you have to store both passwords safely.
* Etherwall.com ( ) a open source wallet offering two modes: Full node or Thin client both using a local geth.exe plus a remote node to be able to display a full transaction history for accounts (not so easy in Ethereum wallet or Mist today) as well as to use the Thin client.
*Highly active question ( )*. Earn 10 reputation (not counting the association bonus ( ) ) in order to answer this question. The reputation requirement helps protect this question from spam and non-answer activity.----




http://www.fastcompany.com/3056651/researchers-find-a-crack-that-drains-supposedly-secure-bitcoin-wallets

It’s always a pain to memorize a password. This is why we so often choose weak ones. A technique used for protecting bitcoin wallets (called a “brain wallet”) seemed to offer a workaround. You use a strong form of cryptography to convert a password that you only keep in your mind—thus reducing vulnerability to malware and other attacks—into something that resists brute force. Brain wallets could thus be stored in the clear (effectively unencrypted) in the bitcoin blockchain, making them always available to an owner without weaknesses that would expose their value to others.
Think again, brainiac! A group of researchers looked into many current brain-wallet implementations and found nothing but moths. Many brain wallets have been pilfered of their value, some within minutes of being added to the blockchain, due to a poor choice of the passwords used to seed more complicated ones.
The blockchain is a public record of all bitcoin transactions, and sites and systems increasingly use transactions to include other information. The blockchain can’t be tampered with after about an hour or so following a transaction being baked in, which makes it a perfect permanent repository. It’s also widely replicated around the globe.
The trouble arises from the same issue as with most successful brute-force methods of cracking passwords: You have to choose a strong starting point, no matter how complex that initial password winds up becoming.
Many of the tools used to create brain wallets use a simple process–taking a sequence of text a user enters and running it through a one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm (SHA-256), which produces a 256-bit number that can’t be reverse engineered to find the original. This hash is used in a few successive operations to transform into the private-public key pair used for bitcoin addresses and to sign transactions. This kind of hashing is very computationally cheap: Anyone, anywhere can take the same bit of text and hash it quickly and test it against the publicly stored password in the blockchain.
Ryan Castellucci of White Ops presented research ( ) into this area last August, and is the common link between two new multi-author papers—one out this week and the other available and being presented in two weeks—that dive even deeper into the problems with brain-wallet protection and the techniques which bad guys have used to empty such wallets. Also last August, Castellucci released Brainflayer ( ) , a tool for automatically testing passwords against brain-wallet encryption keys.
The new paper on cracking ( ) shows a significant increase in efficiency in testing brain-wallet keys—by a factor of 2.5 since last August—and said it’s possible to test about 17.9 billion passwords for $1 by using Amazon Web Services’ Elastic Computing (EC2) on-demand server offering. Castellucci and their co-authors checked a trillion passwords for $55.86 and recovered 18,000 brain wallets. Clever wallet owners had used phrases like “say hello to my little friend” and “dudewheresmycar.”
Castellucci told me via email that the problem isn’t the notion of brain wallets, but that many implementations of the password converters or sites that handle them fail to use cryptographic subtleties now widely employed to protect passwords elsewhere.
First, they typically don’t use a salt, which is a separate piece of data that is combined with the starting password. Salts used at websites to encrypt passwords are often recovered if a password database gets hacked, but they break one shortcut used by crackers: The crackers can’t compute a password once and match it against all identical occurrences (all uses of “123456”, for instance). Rather, they have to compute passwords combined with the salt.
Castellucci suggests an easily remembered piece of data, like someone’s birthdate or email address, would work as a salt because it would be unlikely to be associated in any fashion with the brain wallet. They say that Keybase’s WarpWallet tool allows the use of a salt when creating a brain wallet, and they’d prefer if it were more discouraging about skipping that step. However, Castellucci says users should use random generators to create strong passwords “for high-security applications where offline cracking is a concern.”
In addition, most of these conversions rely on a couple of steps to compute SHA256 hashes, which take vanishingly little effort. There are stronger encryption algorithms that impose a “difficulty” requirement, which might reduce the number of calculations by several orders of magnitude without making it more of a pain for the person created the password. The password owner might have to wait one-tenth or half-a-second for their phrase to be converted to unlock a brain wallet, but that would also reduce the ability to launch a trillion attacks for under sixty bucks to potentially just thousands or hundreds of thousands.
A salt and a difficult encryption algorithm together dramatically reduce the risk of cracking. LastPass suffered a data breach in 2015 ( ) that was embarrassing, but serious consequences were almost entirely averted due to using this design.
The other paper addresses multiple questions, including how many brain wallets exist in the bitcoin blockchain, and how many of those have been hijacked and emptied. That paper, “ The Bitcoin Brain Drain ( ) ,” will be presented at Financial Cryptography 2016 in two weeks.
Castellucci and several colleagues found just 884 wallets in use by anyone other than researchers between September 2011 and August 2015 that had received in total 1,806 Bitcoin (about $100,000). The total wallet count strikes them as surprisingly low. However, they weren’t the first to find them. They note, “We find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 hours but often within minutes.” They also identified common parties who drained multiple accounts, indicating the techniques described are in general use.
The method they used to find bitwallets involved using Castellucci’s Brainflayer to generate 300 billion passwords from a variety of word lists and sources, as well as using brute-force generated methods for short passwords. Thus, they didn’t start with a list of brain wallets and try to crack them; rather, they identified brain wallets by the password being cracked.
The authors conclude that brain wallet use must be rare, but they can’t state it definitively. Castellucci has identified additional brain wallets after being contacted by owners (they’d forgotten parts of their passphrases), through public reports of thefts by owners or brags by bitcoin burglars, and some that Castellucci believes were created by researchers in bulk that they weren’t able to crack completely.----




http://techland.time.com/2011/04/16/online-cash-bitcoin-could-challenge-governments/

Late last year, after WikiLeaks began releasing its trove of State Department cables, many individuals sought to show solidarity with the group by making a donation. They found, however, that many payment processors would not remit money to WikiLeaks, some say as a result of U.S. government pressure. PayPal even froze the group’s account so it couldn’t access funds already collected.
Whether or not payment processors ought to be telling us how to spend our money online, the fact is they can. We rely on third parties to transact online, and when government wants to restrict how we can spend money online, it’s these intermediaries they turn to.
Online gambling and sports betting is perfectly legal in countries like the UK, Ireland and Australia, and a resident of the U.S. will have no problem reaching the websites of gaming sites from those countries. Placing a bet is another matter, however, because the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 requires payments systems to block transactions to online gambling sites.
Similarly, Congress is considering a law like the proposed Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), which would not only allow the Department of Justice to seize the domains of sites suspected of selling counterfeit and pirated goods, but would also require payment processors to block transactions to sites placed on a black list.
To transact online, you have to have an account with a third party like PayPal that you trust will follow your payment instructions. There’s been no such thing as “online cash,” no currency that could be exchanged untraceably between two persons without a third party intermediary–no such thing, that is, until now.
Bitcoin ( ) , an open-source project created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, is the world’s first distributed and anonymous digital currency. That’s a mouthful, but it’s not difficult to understand.
Since the web has been around, digital currencies have come and gone. Think of Facebook Credits ( ) , a digital currency that allows you to buy virtual goods on Facebook applications, or Microsoft Points ( ) , the currency of the Xbox Live Marketplace and Zune store. You exchange dollars for them just like you might exchange dollars for euros, then use them to buy stuff from sellers who’ll take them, say a patisserie in France, or FarmVille in Facebook.
The web has also seen all-purpose digital currencies, from defunct dot-com bubble start-ups Flooz ( ) and Beenz ( ) , to the slightly more successful e-gold ( ). Unlike cash, however, digital currencies to date have had a third party intermediary monitoring transactions. That’s because digital cash is different from physical cash in one very important way: If I hand you a 100 euro bill, I no longer have it. You can’t be as sure of that, however, when the cash is just 1’s and 0’s. So it’s been necessary to have a trusted intermediary deduct the amount from the payer’s account, and add it to the payee’s.
Bitcoin is the first online currency to solve the so-called “ double spending ( ) ” problem without resorting to a third-party intermediary. The key is distributing the database of transactions across a peer-to-peer network. This allows a record to be kept of all transfers, so the same cash can’t be spent twice–because it’s distributed (a lot like BitTorrent), there’s no central authority. This makes digital bitcoins like cash dollars or euros: Hand them over directly to a payee, and you don’t have them anymore, all without the help of a third party.----

The debate may appear abstract, with little bearing on the hard-boiled world of finance, but it is attracting increasing interest from economists and lawyers who say it could have major implications for the future of cryptocurrencies.
How bitcoin and other digital coins are defined could shape how they are regulated around the world. In turn, the rules they are subject to could determine whether they make the leap from a niche to a mainstream asset.
In the United States, federal watchdogs say they see elements of both securities and commodities, but like most major economies have not come up with a set of rules. The European Union, however, will outline a framework this year, which could see crypto wedged into existing regulations, or a whole new set of rules created.
Commodity markets operate with relatively little regulatory oversight. Securities, on the other hand, are typically subject to more onerous rules on price transparency, trade reporting and market abuse.
“When we’re going through the security process, we spend a lot of fees and lawyers to make sure we’re in compliance,” said Benjamin Tsai, president of Wave Financial, an investment manager in Los Angeles overseeing $40 million in crypto.
Bitcoin lending offers lines of credit to crypto firms earning money in cryptocurrencies, such as payment processors or miners, looking to secure traditional money for covering expenses. Also, traders who don’t want to sell their bitcoin holdings use them as collateral to borrow cash for use in algorithmic or high-frequency trading.
The bitcoin lending market has grown quietly as an opaque corner of the cryptocurrency sector, which itself is notorious for its lack of transparency. While there’s little data with which to gauge the size of the lending market, it is widely seen to have expanded rapidly over the past year.
Implied interest rates in these markets - the price of borrowing bitcoin - stand at around 4-5%, Genesis CEO Michael Moro said. On platforms for people to lend cash against bitcoin, rates are as high as 8%.
ICOs are often held by companies seeking to raise funds for blockchain-related or other online projects. They raise capital by issuing digital coins, which grant holders access to the new system or software or a share in profits generated.
For instance, Switzerland-based Aragon - a management platform for decentralised organizations - raised about $25 million in 2017 issuing tokens that gave voting rights on how the system is developed.
Some players say any designation of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments akin to securities may be positive, with burdensome oversight balanced by the potential to allow funds to market cryptocurrencies to a wider pool of investors.
“If they were somehow classified as a financial instrument, then that would have the knock-on effect that they would be eligible for retail funds,” said Nic Niedermowwe, CEO of crypto fund Prime Factor Capital in London.----

"The term bubble tends to indicate a price no reasonable future outcome can justify. In price terms, bitcoin and altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) are in a bubble. In value terms, bitcoin is not."
"If you bet against bitcoin, you are betting against the exchange of value afforded by the internet," he said. "The internet exchanges information through various protocols, just as bitcoin conveys an exchange of value of a good or service when it's spent. So if its utility is increasing, the network value will continue to rise."
Bitcoin's price edged up slightly Tuesday morning. The world's largest digital currency was trading at $11,786.81 at 8:02 a.m. London time (3:02 a.m. ET), up around 1 percent for the session, according to CoinDesk data.
Several commentators, including JPMorgan ( ) CEO Jamie Dimon ( ) , have compared bitcoin to tulip bulbs ( ). Referring to a 17th century phenomenon in the Netherlands, critics have said the cryptocurrency mirrors the price of tulips, which soared to extraordinary highs. The bubble eventually crashed in 1637, resulting in a sharp decline in prices and panic selling.
But Glint's Davies called this a "poor comparison." He said: "The price increases in tulips pale into insignificance compared to the cryptocurrency phenomenon. This doesn't mean bitcoin specifically is in a bubble; however, the other cryptocurrencies are."
Instead, the executive said that alternative digital currencies based on the bitcoin blockchain — which he called an "array of multi-colored variants" — were comparable to the tulip mania phenomenon.
He explained that the mosaic virus — which caused the flowers to turn unusual colors — was similar to alternative cryptocurrencies in the market. Many people are trying to profit from "bastardizing" the original blockchain in a number of ways, such as new digital coin sales called ICOs (initial coin offerings), he added.----

But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.
The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications ( ) built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes.
All of this work is still very early. The first full public version ( ) of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin.
Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.
But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year ( ) that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things.
“Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution — the most elegant solution we have seen to date,” said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.
Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft’s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.
Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system — known as an Ether — that people have recently been buying.
The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, “Blockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting Through the Hype.” ( )
Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress’s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a “significant” purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry’s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.
“A lot of the more established players were thinking, ‘It’s still an experiment,’ ” he said. “It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.”
Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.
*Bitcoin.* A Bitcoin ( ) is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved.
*Blockchain.* A blockchain ( ) is a database maintained communally, that reliably stores digital information ( ). The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored, but non-currency-based companies and governments are also trying to use blockchain technology to store their data.
*Cryptocurrencies.* Since Bitcoin was first conceived in 2008 ( ) , thousands of other virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies ( ) , have been developed. Among them are Ether ( ) , Dogecoin ( ) and Tether ( ).
*Coinbase.* The first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange, Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies ( ) , including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee.
*Crypto finance.* The development of cryptocurrencies spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, known as Decentralized Finance, or DeFi ( ) , allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory, including lending and borrowing.
*NFTs.* A “nonfungible token,” or NFT, is an asset verified using blockchain technology ( ) , in which a network of computers records transactions and gives buyers proof of authenticity and ownership. NFTs make digital artworks ( ) unique, and therefore sellable.
Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.
The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain — the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source — say, The Associated Press — the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.
A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin’s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software’s development.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers — or nodes — helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.
One of Mr. Buterin’s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.
The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.
Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.
“Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,” Mr. Bonneau said. “It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.”----

A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin ( ) , for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.
One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks ( ) , that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.
A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this time line. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.
The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT) ( ).
First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first widespread application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies ( ) , decentralized finance (DeFi) ( ) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ( ) , and smart contracts ( ).
Imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000 computers used to maintain a database holding all of its client’s account information. This company owns a warehouse building that contains all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all of the information contained within them. This, however, provides a single point of failure. What happens if the electricity at that location goes out? What if its Internet connection is severed? What if it burns to the ground? What if a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? In any case, the data is lost or corrupted.
What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data stored therein—if somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.
To validate new entries or records to a block, a majority of the decentralized network’s computing power would need to agree to it. To prevent bad actors from validating bad transactions or double spends ( ) , blockchains are secured by a consensus mechanism such as proof of work (PoW) ( ) or proof of stake (PoS) ( ). These mechanisms allow for agreement even when no single node is in charge.
Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers ( ) that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes.
For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.
Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public ( ) - private key ( ) pair). As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.
Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of the network has reached a consensus to do so. That’s because each block contains its own hash ( ) , along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned time stamp. Hash codes are created by a mathematical function ( ) that turns digital information into a string of numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well.
Let’s say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with everyone else’s copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see this one copy stand out, and that hacker’s version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate.
Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of the copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon chain. Such an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to redo all of the blocks because they would now have different time stamps and hash codes.
Due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a feat probably would be insurmountable. This would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless. Doing such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the blockchain. The network members would then hard fork ( ) off to a new version of the chain that has not been affected. This would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, making the attack ultimately pointless, as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad actor were to attack the new fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far more economically incentivized than attacking it.
Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document time stamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.
The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto ( ) , referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”
The key thing to understand here is that Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments, but blockchain can, in theory, be used to immutably record any number of data points. As discussed above, this could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.
Currently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in a variety of ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections. The nature of blockchain’s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult to occur. For example, a voting system could work such that each citizen of a country would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token. Each candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to vote. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate both the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.
Blockchains have been heralded as being a disruptive force to the finance sector, and especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.
As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store data about monetary transactions. Today, there are more than 10,000 other cryptocurrency systems running on blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions as well.
Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever, and a host of others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.
Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, as well as hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. Using blockchain gives brands the ability to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally, its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms of blockchain implementation.
Perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account. Even if you do make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.
By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transactions processed in as little as 10 minutes—basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period of time.
Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a user’s data and currency are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a user’s bank is hacked, the client’s private information is at risk. If the client’s bank collapses or the client lives in a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. In 2008, several failing banks were bailed out—partially using taxpayer money. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was first conceived and developed.
By spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. It can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do business, both domestically and internationally.
Using cryptocurrency wallets ( ) for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for those who have no state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any real infrastructure to provide identification. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage accounts—and, therefore, no way to safely store wealth.
Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain to securely store their patients’ medical records. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key, so that they are only accessible by certain individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.
If you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that the process of recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.
This process is not just costly and time-consuming—it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.
In war-torn countries or areas that have little to no government or financial infrastructure, and certainly no Recorder’s Office, it can be nearly impossible to prove ownership of a property. If a group of people living in such an area is able to leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear time lines of property ownership could be established.
A smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out.
Say, for example, that a potential tenant would like to lease an apartment using a smart contract. The landlord agrees to give the tenant the door code to the apartment as soon as the tenant pays the security deposit. Both the tenant and the landlord would send their respective portions of the deal to the smart contract, which would hold onto and automatically exchange the door code for the security deposit on the date when the lease begins. If the landlord doesn’t supply the door code by the lease date, then the smart contract refunds the security deposit. This would eliminate the fees and processes typically associated with the use of a notary, a third-party mediator, or attorneys.
As in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.”
As mentioned above, blockchain could be used to facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election.
For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.
Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands of computers. This removes almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain. For that error to spread to the rest of the blockchain, it would need to be made by at least 51% of the network’s computers—a near impossibility for a large and growing network the size of Bitcoin’s.
Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction, a notary to sign a document, or a minister to perform a marriage. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.
Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the entire network, would be compromised.
Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week, blockchain is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Transactions can be completed in as little as 10 minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for cross-border ( ) trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.
Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.
When a user makes a public transaction, their unique code—called a public key, as mentioned earlier—is recorded on the blockchain. Their personal information is not. If a person has made a Bitcoin purchase on an exchange that requires identification, then the person’s identity is still linked to their blockchain address—but a transaction, even when tied to a person’s name, does not reveal any personal information.
Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. Thousands of computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is edited in any way, that block’s hash code changes—however, the hash code on the block after it would not. This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without notice.
Most blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that anyone and everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. This also means that there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.
Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and Bitcoin is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth. Nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries, where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.
These people often earn a little money that is paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places of living, leaving them subject to robbery or unnecessary violence. Keys to a bitcoin wallet can be stored on a piece of paper, a cheap cell phone, or even memorized if necessary. For most people, it is likely that these options are more easily hidden than a small pile of cash under a mattress.
Blockchains of the future are also looking for solutions to not only be a unit of account for wealth storage but also to store medical records, property rights, and a variety of other legal contracts.
Although blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the PoW system which the bitcoin network uses to validate transactions, consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the power from the millions of computers on the bitcoin network is close to what Norway and Ukraine consume annually.
Despite the costs of mining bitcoin, users continue to drive up their electricity bills to validate transactions on the blockchain. That’s because when miners ( ) add a block to the bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with enough bitcoin to make their time and energy worthwhile. When it comes to blockchains that do not use cryptocurrency, however, miners will need to be paid or otherwise incentivized to validate transactions.
Bitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin’s PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it’s estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum perform better than bitcoin, they are still limited by blockchain. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 65,000 TPS.
The other issue is that each block can only hold so much data. The block size debate ( ) has been, and continues to be, one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains going forward.
While confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road ( ) , an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace operating from February 2011 until October 2013, when it was shut down by the FBI.
The dark web ( ) allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the Tor Browser ( ) and make illegal purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Current U.S. regulations require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account, verify the identity of each customer, and confirm that customers do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations. This system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts but also allows criminals to more easily transact. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked world, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash.
While Bitcoin had been used early on for such purposes, its transparent nature and maturity as a financial asset has actually seen illegal activity migrate to other cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Dash. Today, illegal activity accounts for only a very small fraction of all Bitcoin transactions ( ).
Many in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation over cryptocurrencies. While it is getting increasingly difficult and near impossible to end something like Bitcoin as its decentralized network grows, governments could theoretically make it illegal to own cryptocurrencies or participate in their networks.
A blockchain platform allows users and developers to create novel uses of an existing blockchain infrastructure. One example is Ethereum ( ) , which has a native cryptocurrency known as ether ( ETH ( ) ). But the Ethereum blockchain also allows the creation of smart contracts and programmable tokens used in initial coin offerings (ICOs) ( ) , and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are all built up around the Ethereum infrastructure and secured by nodes on the Ethereum network.
The number of live blockchains is growing every day at an ever-increasing pace. As of 2022, there are more than 10,000 active cryptocurrencies based on blockchain, with several hundred more non-cryptocurrency blockchains.
Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two mathematicians who wanted to implement a system where document time stamps could not be tampered with. In the late 1990s, cypherpunk Nick Szabo ( ) proposed using a blockchain to secure a digital payments system, known as bit gold ( ) (which was never implemented).
With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen.

Three weeks into 2018, it remains almost impossible to find a gaming graphics card selling for anywhere near its retail price, regardless of whether you’re looking for a GPU from Nvidia or AMD. The monthslong shortage, fueled by a rush on graphics cards that’s driven by people looking to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, continues to confound individuals that just want to buy a video card and use it in a gaming computer to, y’know, play PC games. Now it seems that Nvidia is trying to prioritize those customers over miners — or rather, push retailers to do so.
Cryptocurrency mining requires immense computational power, and miners figured out years ago that the chips in many high-end graphics cards are well-suited to the task. The values of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent months — a single bitcoin is currently worth well over $11,000 ( ) , although that figure is in flux and has been trending downward since a peak above $19,000 last month. This has led people to put together “mining rigs” — after buying multiple consumer graphics cards for the necessary computing power — and try to turn a profit on their investment by mining for cryptocurrency.
For much of 2017, the increased demand for GPUs drove the cost of powerful cards — like Nvidia’s GeForce GTX ( ) 1070, GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti, and AMD’s Radeon RX ( ) 570, 580, Vega 56 and Vega 64 — well above their suggested retail prices. For instance, the GTX 1070’s MSRP is $380, but it was selling for upward of $450 last year. Lower-end cards like the GTX 1050 and 1060 weren’t affected initially, but miners have moved on to them as the better cards have sold out, pushing up prices for the cheaper GPUs as well. And as the value of bitcoin spiked in December, prices rose even further.
“Gamers come first for Nvidia,” said Boris Böhles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region, in an interview with the German publication ComputerBase ( ). “All activities around our GeForce products are for our core audience. We recommend our trading partners make arrangements to ensure that gamers’ needs are still met in the current climate.”
It’s unclear how far retailers can or would be willing to go in this respect. Many of them have already tried limiting GPU purchases to one or two per customer, hoping to block miners looking to buy graphics cards in bulk. But that tactic seems to have been ineffective, if current prices are any indication. The GTX 1070 — which, remember, has an MSRP of $380 — is out of stock at retailers like Newegg, where it’s fetching upward of $900 ( ) from third-party sellers.----

Bitcoin continued its week-long slide first sparked by Elon Musk's climate-related concerns over its mining process. Billionaire Mike Novogratz predicted bitcoin will consolidate ( ) somewhere between $40,000 and $50,000 for up to six weeks after Musk's criticism of its energy use.

JPMorgan said in a note on Tuesday institutional investors seem to be shifting away from bitcoin, and moving back into traditional gold ( ). This indicates a reversal of the trend seen over the past six months.
"It is not clear what is driving this shift," strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. "Perhaps institutional investors are fleeing bitcoin as they see its previous two quarter uptrend ending and thus seek the stability of traditional gold away from the rapid downshifting of digital gold."
That has ratcheted up regulatory risks tremendously, according to Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA. "China's actions raise the mercury on that front, and the Colonial situation may finally spur the US into action. I suspect they will not be alone," he said.----

https://www.elliptic.co/blog/elliptic-follows-bitcoin-ransoms-paid-by-darkside-ransomware-victims

Elliptic has identified the Bitcoin wallet used by the DarkSide ransomware group to receive ransom payments from its victims, based on our intelligence collection and analysis of blockchain transactions. This wallet received the 75 BTC payment (worth $4.4 million at the time of the transaction) made by Colonial Pipeline on May 8, following the crippling cyberattack on its operations - leading to widespread fuel shortages in the US.
Our analysis shows that the wallet has been active since 4th March 2021 and has received 57 payments from 21 different wallets. Some of these payments directly match ransoms known to have been paid to DarkSide by other victims, such as 78.29 BTC (also worth $4.4 million at the time of the transaction) sent by chemical distribution company Brenntag on May 11 ( ).
In addition, our analysis shows that a previously unreported ransom payment for ~$320,000 was made to DarkSide on the 10th May: the bitcoins originated from the same exchange used by Colonial Pipeline.
It has been reported ( ) within the past hours that DarkSide itself has ceased operations and has had its funds seized - and indeed their wallet was emptied of the $5 million in Bitcoin it contained on Thursday afternoon. There has been speculation ( ) that the bitcoins were seized by the US government - if that is the case they didn’t actually seize most of Colonial Pipeline’s ransom payment - the majority of that was moved out of the wallet on the 9th May.
But by tracing previous outflows from the wallet, we can gain insights into how DarkSide and its affiliates were laundering their previous proceeds. What we find is that 18% of the Bitcoin was sent to a small group of exchanges. This information will provide law enforcement with critical leads to identify the perpetrators of these attacks.
An additional 4% has been sent to Hydra, the world’s largest darknet marketplace, servicing customers in Russia and neighboring countries. As we revealed in previous research ( ) , Hydra offers cash-out services alongside narcotics, hacking tools and fake IDs. These allow Bitcoin to be converted into gift vouchers, prepaid debit cards or cash Rubles. If you’re a Russian cybercriminal and you want to cash-out your crypto, then Hydra is an attractive option.
By identifying this wallet, Elliptic’s clients, including financial institutions, crypto exchanges and fintechs will now be alerted to any client deposits that originate from the DarkSide wallet. By using our transaction and wallet screening tools ( ) they can ensure that DarkSide and other ransomware operators cannot cash-out or exchange their Bitcoin proceeds, disincentivizing this activity.

https://www.wired.com/story/cryptocurrency-scams-ico-trolling/

Facebook announced in a blog post ( ) Tuesday that it was banning cryptocurrency advertising from the platform entirely. The company said that many ads for cryptocurrency investment opportunities, like initial coin offerings, were “not currently operating in good faith.” Facebook has a point. Take Prodeum for example, a cryptocurrency startup that appeared online Thursday. By Monday, it was gone.
Prodeum's 12-page white paper outlined plans to build a database of fruits and vegetables on the Ethereum blockchain ( ). That idea might sound strange, but it’s not the first ( ) of its kind. Prodeum asked investors to help raise as much as 5,400 ether—roughly $6.5 million—in an ICO. But after collecting what looks like less ( ) than the price of two Chipotle burritos, Prodeum disappeared. The company’s sparkly, professional-looking website was replaced with a single, trolling word: penis.
A press release on both an NBC affiliate ( ) and a New Jersey local news site ( ) vanished, along with Prodeum’s website, Twitter account, and Telegram channel. Emails to the startup’s customer support address bounce back. It seems like Prodeum—which sounds suspiciously ( ) like the urinary-tract infection medication Prodium—was yet another cryptocurrency scam.
It joins a long line. In April of last year, there was Mumbai-based OneCoin, a once-lauded blockchain startup that was discovered to be a Ponzi scheme—but not before its founders allegedly funneled ( ) at least $350 million through Germany. Then there was Confido, which disappeared ( ) after raising over $370,000. Don’t forget BitConnect ( ) , an anonymous cryptocurrency exchange that was accused of being a Ponzi scheme numerous times before it finally shut down.
Not every ICO is a scam, and many cryptocurrency startups are legitimate. But the shady, largely unregulated cryptocurrency investment landscape is littered with dozens of fraudulent ventures. (They're also susceptible to hackers; more than 10 percent of the $3.7 billion raised through ICOs has been lost or stolen, according to a recent analysis ( ) from the accounting firm Ernst & Young.)
The cryptocurrency market is ripe for scammers because it’s relatively new, backed by tons of hype, and involves complicated technology. It’s easier to dupe someone into investing in your ICO in 2018 than your fake real estate business—and plenty of people have. A cryptocurrency startup only needs a swanky website and an official-looking white paper. There are also plenty of services to help streamline the process: You can automate ( ) your token sale, or have someone write fake news articles ( ) hyping up your venture.
Confusion around blockchain technology also makes much of the public a potentially easy mark. Blockchains are encrypted, distributed ledgers that operate without a central authority like a bank. The ledger itself is securely stored on many computers, so it can’t be altered or hacked. The Ethereum blockchain—on which Prodeum relied—allows for more complicated applications to be built on top of it. Eth-Tweet ( ) , for example, is a decentralized microblogging service built on the Ethereum blockchain.
Here’s where the ICO comes in. An initial coin offering allows you to buy some of the tokens that power a specific application. If there were a WIRED Blockchain Application for instance, users might pay one WIRED Reader Token in order to view an article. The WIRED Blockchain Application ICO would allow investors to get in on the tokens at a lower price. The idea is that later on, as demand for the application rises (and people read more articles) the price of the tokens would go up, allowing early investors to make a profit.
To complicate matters further, blockchain startup founders frequently tell investors that they’re not putting their money in something akin to a traditional security, but actually into the technology itself. (It’s often unclear what that means in practice.) And some startups, like block.one—which raised ( ) over $700 million—claim the opposite, arguing ( ) that their tokens can’t actually be used for anything at all.
The exact terms of an ICO are usually laid out in an accompanying white paper, which is often the only documentation that investors have to decipher whether a new startup is a solid opportunity. Plenty of ICOs raise millions of dollars in cryptocurrency without even having a working prototype of their software. Even when a demonstration is available, only savvy investors can really evaluate whether an application will be feasible. Many startups don't even write their white papers themselves: The task is outsourced to services ( ) that write the papers for them.
Prodeum’s white paper, now offline, described a system involving two different types of tokens. On the surface, it looks more legitimate than many genuine ICOs, even listing four blockchain experts supposedly involved in the project. But one of the individuals listed, Petar Jandric, said ( ) on LinkedIn that he was a “victim of identity theft,” and wasn’t actually involved in Prodeum. Vytautas Kašėta‏, another expert listed, tells WIRED his name was also stolen for the project.
Even genuine ICOs are subject to other kinds of scams, like those involving market manipulation. There are numerous “pump and dump” schemes for example, where groups of investors on platforms like Telegram and Discord ( ) artificially inflate a cryptocurrency’s value. If you can’t manage to manipulate the market, there’s also always hacking. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization, for example, famously raised $150 million in an ICO and then was hacked ( ) , resulting in the loss of over $50 million. Plenty of other startups have faced similar fates ( ).
Despite walking and talking like traditional stocks, ICOs have so far largely avoided serious scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that regulates investment markets. Many blockchain startups are international and anonymous—which can place them out of the SEC's purview. That lack of oversight is another reason so many scams proliferate.
The SEC appears to have started clamping down on cryptocurrencies, however. In December, the agency’s new cyber unit announced it had filed its first ever complaint ( ) , against the Canadian couple behind the cryptocurrency startup PlexCorps. The agency alleges that the couple swindled customers out of $15 million by unrealistically telling them they could make up to 1,354 percent returns on their investment.
On Tuesday, ( ) the SEC announced it had halted one of the largest ICOs ever, for the Dallas-based startup AriseBank. The celebrity-endorsed company, which claimed to be a “decentralized bank,” falsely advertised that it could offer customers FDIC-insured banking accounts. The same day, Bloomberg ( ) reported that the US Commodity Futures sent a subpoena to Bitfinex and Tether, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges ( ). Facebook's ad ban, then, is just one of a series of efforts to clean up an unruly, scam-riddled system.
Ultimately, blockchain scams aren’t much different from other types of investment fraud. Whether you dress it up as an ICO or a hedge fund, the grift generally works the same: Convince unassuming individuals that you can make them rich, then steal their money. While the SEC has yet to aggressively go after much of the cryptocurrency market, it does regularly file complaints against hundreds ( ) of other scams designed to rip people off. Humans have been trying to swindle each other out of money for thousands of years. Cryptocurrencies are just the latest opportunity to do so.
“Fraudulent scams like Ponzi schemes and sponsors who pocket investor’s money have been around for a long time. Fraudulent ICOs can be used to repackage old frauds in a new wrapper,” says Todd Kornfeld, a securities attorney at the firm Pepper Hamilton.
That’s not to say that the cryptocurrencies aren’t a particularly volatile and shady thing to invest in now. A recent hoax claimed that some guy scammed his way into over $1 million by convincing people Chuck E. Cheese tokens were bitcoins. The story wasn’t true ( ) , but you can see now why it was so easily believed—the cryptocurrency marketplace is full of plenty of crazier scams.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/heres-how-scammers-are-using-fake-news-to-screw-with-bitcoin

In the largely unregulated world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, fraudsters are getting rich by deliberately spreading false information to affect the price of their holdings using social media, scam news sites, and private chat apps.
*On Saturday, Jan. 14* , a Twitter account purporting to be that of John McAfee, the outlandish founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee, shared a bit of investment advice. “Coin of the day,” the account tweeted, promoting GVT, a new digital coin that had started trading in the fall of 2017.
Despite his infamy ( ) (he founded one of the most successful antivirus software companies ever, fled from Belize police in 2012 after being wanted for questioning in the death of his neighbor, and ran for president in 2016), McAfee is still viewed by some as a cryptocurrency sage; he was touting bitcoin as the currency of the future long before its recent gains. And — for some — McAfee shilling for GVT was good reason to buy it, a premonition of future buying frenzies and a soaring valuation.
So they bought. And they bought without noticing the additional "L" in the Twitter username or the missing verification check that distinguished the bogus McAfee account from the real one, @OfficialMcAfee. When the tweet was first broadcast at around 3 p.m. ET, GVT was bought and sold on the market at $30. By 3:04, it was at $45, and trading volume had doubled.
But by 3:19, GVT's price had fallen back to $30.29. The smart money — the early money —had gotten out, leaving the late money holding a bag of now-diminished value. It was a classic pump-and-dump scheme ( ) orchestrated in a chat room called “Big Pump Signal," which encouraged its members to retweet or otherwise promote the bogus McAfee and buy and sell GVT at the appointed times.
In the wild world of cryptocurrency trading that's largely untouched by regulation, the spread of fake news and unsubstantiated rumors is becoming common practice among bad actors looking to prey on novices. It’s the perfect environment in which to proliferate misinformation; it's mercurial, confusing, and full of uneducated, overeager traders hoping to strike it rich.
But learning takes time and finding good information can try your patience — particularly when it seems like everyone around you ( ) seems to be making money hand over fist by acting on the latest blogged or tweeted investment tidbit. Usman Chohan, an economist and researcher at the University of New South Wales, compares the current hysteria to the “irrational exuberance” of the dot-com era where paper fortunes rose and fell based on an illogical, capricious market.
Russia-based Genesis Vision, the company whose currency was exploited in the pump and dump above, is a good example. The total value of its four-month-old digital coin currently hovers around $75 million, even after the wild price swings. Genesis Vision doesn’t yet offer a single product or service; it has only a slick website and a white paper ( ) explaining its intent to build a decentralized, global trading network sometime this year. Even the company’s leadership views the valuation of GVT with a raised eyebrow.
But that clearly did weigh on the minds of those who ended up deciding to trade GVT. Seeing that it was a top-25 traded coin on Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange that allows for the trading of so-called alt coins, the leaders of Big Pump Signal, the free-to-join Telegram group, told their users on Saturday to expect “a different setup.”
That fake McAfee tweet, which a Big Pump Signal admin linked to in Telegram with instructions to retweet, may have been shared more than 1,300 times, according to screenshots. It was eventually deleted, along with its associated fake account and Telegram hyperlink. An early promoter and organizer of Big Pump Signal, one of dozens of pump-and-dump groups on Telegram, did not respond to a request for comment to BuzzFeed News. A spokesperson for Telegram did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“A lot of outside volume coming in this pump, amazing work by the helper who gave us the idea for this social media plan and amazing work by the ones who retweeted it, we really made a statement,” the administrator for Big Pump Signal wrote to the group at 3:42 p.m. ET, after the scheme was complete. “There were more outside users involved than any other time.”
Those outside users may have seen a 33% drop in their holdings if they bought GVT at its peak. And they’re not the only ones who were hurt. A quick scan of Twitter turns up some of Big Pump Signal’s own members complaining about losing money. Oftentimes, the only people certain to benefit in a pump and dump are its organizers — and sometimes they're running smaller, more exclusive Telegram groups intended to further maximize their schemes.
Last August, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned about cryptocurrency fraud and ICO-related scams on its public investor site, ( ) noting that bad actors engage “in market manipulation, such as by spreading false and misleading information about a company.” Still, it's only announced charges against one alleged ICO scam ( ) , and it’s unclear what government agency would have jurisdiction, or interest, in the pump and dumps that happen daily via Telegram groups.
*While pump-and-dump scams* typically target new ICOs, more established cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, are also vulnerable to manipulation via misinformation. In June, ethereum lost billions of dollars from its market capitalization after rumors of its creator's death began circulating on 4chan, the anonymous messaging board famous for its trolls and conspiracy theorists.
“Vitalik Buterin confirmed dead,” the post read, referring to the 23-year-old genius behind the cryptocurrency that trades as ETH. “Insiders now unloading ETH. Fatal car crash. And now we have our answer. He was the glue. It will be difficult for ETH to recover and the entire crypto sphere is in big trouble.”
At the time, ethereum — which had astonishingly charted a roughly 4,800% increase in price earlier in the year — was suffering a nasty downward slide. Rumors of Buterin’s death dramatically exacerbated its volatility. The digital currency began to stabilize only after Buterin posted a photo of himself ( ) confirming he was alive and well.
Because bitcoin is still an emerging currency with no underlying assets, it is particularly susceptible to rumors as well. Among the most common is the constant discussion about which large institution or retailer will embrace bitcoin next, giving bitcoin validation and pushing it further into the mainstream.
Some have taken advantage of that. In September, James Altucher, a self-proclaimed bitcoin expert who runs various online ads for his “Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies” video courses, wrote in an online newsletter that “I am certain Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin.” (It's worth noting that in 2013, he had tweeted ( ) that “bitcoin is a fad, or a scam, or a ponzi scheme, or worse.”)
“Amazon could make the announcement as early as October 26, at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call,” he wrote, ( ) citing a quote taken out of context from an Amazon executive and other speculative information. Despite this, the information was reported as fact on Squawker, a conspiracy website ( ) with about 225,000 total visits a month according to SimilarWeb, a web analytics firm. Then it was recycled in a report on CoinTelegraph ( ) , an online cryptocurrency publication, and German newspaper Die Welt. ( )
“I said potentially as early as, not on this date,” Altucher told BuzzFeed News when asked about the information he spread in his ad. “There really is misinformation out there about cryptocurrencies and that’s what I’m trying to get people to avoid.”
When Oct. 26 came and went with no bitcoin announcement from Amazon, Alutcher updated his newsletter to read, “Amazon could make the announcement as early as February 2, at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call.”
Chohan also pointed to unverified screenshots posted to Reddit that showed an Amazon customer service representative suggesting that Amazon is “working on” a solution to accept bitcoin. “Think about how easy it is to forge a chat like that,” he said. “If you bought some bitcoin, you would have every incentive to put that on Reddit so that the bigger fool comes in and buys it.”
*Traditional fake news* pushers have also turned to cryptocurrency as a new vector to spread their online scams. In capitalizing on the gold rush, they’ve created sites that mimic mainstream media web pages, with the hopes of getting internet users to click through to scams that promise people they can “earn one bitcoin a day” after they’ve entered in personal data and credit card information.
“Richard Branson And Elon Musk Invested $17-Million In a Bitcoin Tech Startup,” read one such headline ( ) on a website that spoofed CNN, sporting the same layout as CNN’s real site, the byline of an actual CNN Technology reporter ( ) , a faked Facebook comments section, and a bogus CNN-money-report.com URL. The website, which discussed a bitcoin trading system dubbed “the Bitcoin Code,” used social media to bring in more than 425,000 total visits between September and December, according to traffic estimations from SimilarWeb.
A Google search of the Bitcoin Code immediately brings up fraud alerts, warning users against handing their money over to the website. And while the fake CNN URL has been scrubbed from Facebook, a simple Twitter search ( ) suggests people shared and fell for the hoax last fall. It’s also not the only website in the network spreading false stories for financial gain. A search of other sites that share the same IP address reveals a network of 72 web addresses — some active, some not — promoting the Bitcoin Code. A SimilarWeb search of a handful of these sites shows the vast majority of their visitors come from social media.
That’s the case with Dorothylewis.online ( ) , one of the 72 sites, which received roughly 50,000 visits between September and October by sharing fake bitcoin investment news about Musk and, as one Twitter user pointed out ( ) , purchased sponsored posts on Facebook to increase the audience.
Facebook didn't answer specific questions about those ads, which were also seen by Gavin Sheridan, a journalist and founder of legal startup Vizlegal. Sheridan began tweeting ( ) about them last Sunday after he was targeted by paid a post from a Facebook page belonging to “Ireland Crypto.” The sponsored ad featured a picture of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and a caption that news caption that read, “Richard Hacks Multiple Crypto Exchanges!”
“I knew straight away it was a scam,” said Sheridan. “But if you’re a vulnerable older relative of mine, or using a device that’s not a laptop, it’s harder to interrogate the provenance of that link.”
Sheridan traced the ad to another spoof CNN page with the headline, “Richard Branson Reveals Trading Bitcoins Will Make You Quit your job in 30 Days!” That page, in turn, linked to a page called ConsistentProfits.co with an autoplay video that promises to teach people how to make 10 bitcoins every week. A domain search on the site reveals a likely front company with ties to addresses in Israel and Las Vegas.
“You watch the video, it tries to hook you, you sign up there, you put in your credit card, and there is no data protection,” said Sheridan. “I’ve seen this stuff for years on Facebook, and it’s something they’ve chosen to ignore.”
Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president of ads, eventually caught wind of Sheridan’s tweets, and the page was taken down, but it’s unclear how long it was up, how widely it was promoted, and how many people it engaged. “These ads violate not only our policies, but our principles as well,” he tweeted. ( ) “We have zero tolerance for this sort of behavior on the platform.”
That zero tolerance is hypothetical, at the moment, as other pages that promote cryptocurrency scams continue to proliferate on Facebook. A September post from Dorothylewis.online claiming Elon Musk invested $770 million in a bitcoin startup was still online when this article published. It has been broadcast through Facebook’s ad network, amassed 1,500 likes, and has been shared more than 300 times. Many commenters are skeptical of the story. Others, not so much.----




https://theoutline.com/post/3074/inside-the-group-chats-where-people-pump-and-dump-cryptocurrency

Every few days, 200,000 strangers come together online to buy little-known cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins, at exactly 2 p.m. Eastern time. Then, anywhere from 30 to 120 seconds later, they sell them en masse (or at least try to). Those who buy and sell at the right time can potentially make out like bandits.
“Pumping is the process through which a large group of people agree to buy a certain coin at a particular time,” reads the welcome messages for The Alt Pump, a pump group based in the messaging app Discord that has more than 30,000 members. “With this group, you will have large amounts of people buying a coin at the same time. This will pump the price straight up. After this the dumping part comes in. After the price rises tremendously up because of the pumping, we start selling at a good profit. This is called dumping.”
The pump group ethos is simple: Buy low, sell high. The implication is that investors outside the pump group will see the rapidly rising price and rush to buy in, anxious not to miss the next Bitcoin-style gold rush. But the reality is a bit more complex.
Instant, easy wealth is always the founding principle of a pump group, whether it’s presented in terms that seem reasonable, like “at least a 300% return on your investment,” or ridiculous, “[GET] READY FOR A FUCKING LAMBO” (both of which are actual messages sent in groups). These groups are promoted heavily on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as both ads and general posts, but they almost exclusively operate on semi-anonymous messaging services like Discord and Telegram.
The whole scam works like this: First, an organizer grows their group to an acceptable size (2,000 seems to be the minimum, based on member-hungry Discord and Telegram posts) through promotion and by spamming join links. Next, they will find an unheard-of coin and direct everyone to buy it, driving the price up. Commonly called altcoins (or less politely, shitcoins), these alternative cryptocurrencies are easy to make and generally worthless ( ). The organizer sets a “target price,” and then it’s basically a free-for-all, as participants decide on their own when to sell.
I spent a day lurking in 12 of these groups ranging from large (Big Pump Signal, 200K) to small (Cali Pumps, 2K) and chatting with their members. In most established groups, the pumping process itself is surprisingly well-organized. Group leaders provide specific instructions to their members that include the exact time a pump will occur (translated into multiple time zones), what exchange the pump will take place on, what the “target” inflation price is, how the pump signal will be provided (some groups say they use images instead of text, to counter bots), and a number of other helpful tips and tricks. As it grows closer to pump o’clock, organizers will send out a flurry of reminders and inspiring messages in order to, well, pump up the troops.
After the pump signal is given, group members flood the chosen exchange, buying up as much of the coin as they can for cheap. Members are also expected to promote the coin on social media in order to create buzz around it, which is intended to attract new investors to the currency. As BuzzFeed reported, members of these groups sometimes even create fake celebrity tweets or fabricate news stories ( ) in order to affect the price of a coin. Members are instructed to “dump” the coin — meaning, sell it as quickly as possible — once the coin reaches a preset “target” price, in order to make a profit, however, the market usually collapses long before then due to panic and general volatility.
On January 13, Big Pump Signal announced the pump of the day would be GVT, a four-month-old Russia-based altcoin created by an apparently product-less company called Genesis Vision ( ). All of Big Pump Signal’s take place on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
Thirty-four seconds before the pump signal was given for GVT in the general chat room, the coin was trading for approximately $29.22, according to data collected by CoinMarketCap ( ). Almost immediately afterwards, it began to rise in value. Four minutes and 16 seconds after the pump signal, it was at $35.05, and at nine minutes and 16 seconds post-pump-signal it had reached its peak at $45.41. Anyone who invested immediately and dumped right at the peak could have potentially earned a 55.51 percent return on their investment. In other words, if a participant invested the equivalent of $1,000 immediately after the signal dropped and happened to randomly guess when the peak would be and sold exactly then, they would have made $1,555.10 (minus the .1 percent trading fee charged by Binance and any fees for withdrawing their money from the exchange). This is about the best case scenario you can hope for, but it’s an unlikely outcome for the average investor.
The group’s pump of BNT — an altcoin created by the B protocol Foundation in June 2017 — turned out a little differently. Forty-six seconds before the pump signal was given, BNT was trading at $7.91, according to data collected by CoinMarketCap ( ). At its peak, four minutes and 15 seconds post-pump-signal, BNT was only trading at $9.67, and then quickly plunged back down into oblivion, meaning the highest possible earnings were around 22.25 percent. That means if a participant bought $1,000 worth of BNT as soon as the signal dropped and and somehow knew to sell four minutes and 15 seconds later at the peak, they would have made $1,222.50 (minus the .1 percent trading fee charged by Binance and any fees for withdrawing their money from the exchange).
“Eighty to 90 percent of the people lose and they'll probably think, ‘Oh I just I just waited too long to sell it. I could just do it again. Let me try it again,’” said Chris Koerner, an altcoin expert and veteran cryptocurrency trader, in a phone interview. Some organizers charge a fee to participate in the pump — which can be anywhere from $10 to $1,000 — meaning they’ll make money regardless, while most of the members are essentially just gambling. “And it becomes this addiction: You just keep losing money until you don't have any left, and the organizer makes out like a bandit, because not only is he profiting off buying it before anyone else, but he's charging people for the group.”
Tiered access to the pump signal (a.k.a., the message that lets everyone know which coin to buy) seems to be the norm for most groups. Users are generally assigned ranks based on their participation in an affiliate system, or by the amount of cash they’ve sent to an organizer in order to obtain a “premium” membership. High-ranking members may be sent the pump signal anywhere from half-a-second to three seconds earlier than the general pool, a disparity the groups advertise openly.
“They are 90 percent a scam to take money and the ones at the top will always win,” said Brad Spann, an active member of a number of the most popular pump groups, over Discord chat. Like most involved in the scam, Spann first heard about the groups through Twitter, but quickly became hooked. “Once I got in a group, people would send me links to other groups to join so they could rank up to get a faster chance at getting the signal for the coin for the pump and dump.”
While a couple of seconds might not seem like much of an advantage to an outsider, in the fast-paced world of pump and dump, it makes all the difference. If you don’t buy into the chosen altcoin within the first few seconds of the pump, you’re probably going lose money. The general consensus within the groups themselves is that this is due to bots, which are allegedly used by members to buy and sell large amounts of coin almost instantly. The fact that it is so easy to lose money may just be due to the structure of the scam, however, in which elite members are the only ones positioned to profit.
“A lot of people don't feel that [the tiered system] is fair,” said Spann. “[S]ome groups have thought about changing that and making it free for all pumps and then doing a giveaway or raffle for those who invite more people. In the end th[e] admins of these groups will always want more people in their groups — so they can make more gains on bigger pumps — because they always buy in first because they know the coin they will pump.”
A quick scan of Twitter ( ) (or even some of the groups’ own Discord chat channels) will quickly reveal a number of users complaining about losing money. “This wasn’t a good pump,” wrote one ( ) in response to MEGA Pump’s January 20 pump of BNT. “When we [received] the notice for the coin it was already at it top [sic]. A lot of people lost money.”
Though the technology for these sort of schemes has been around for years, pump and dump groups seem to have recently skyrocketed in popularity. The popular pump groups I found on Discord and Telegram were created within the last two months, and mentions of pump groups on Twitter ( ) and elsewhere from November 2017 and earlier pale in comparison to recent stats ( ). The same goes for mentions ( ) of pump-group-related ads ( ) on Facebook and Twitter.
People may be taking a chance on these obviously sketchy “investment opportunities” out of cryptocurrency-related FOMO. In the wake of Bitcoin’s extremely high-profile year, everyone wants in on the seemingly magical cryptocurrency market. Koerner thinks most people’s utter lack of financial knowledge is also to blame. “I think they don't have any experience in the stock market...and people are exploiting that,” he told The Outline. “I think most people don’t realize [sic] there has to be demand for what you're selling at that crazy price. And if there's not, then the price drops like crazy and you lose.”----




https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/bitcoin-property-currency-irs-rules

It’s official, at least according to the taxman: bitcoin is not a currency. The Internal Revenue Service ruled Tuesday that the controversial cryptocurrency and its rivals will be treated as property, not cash, for tax purposes.
"The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for US federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency," according to an IRS news release ( ).
The ruling means gains in value will be treated as capital gains and as such could be subject to lower tax rates than income. The top long-term capital gains tax rate is 20%, while the top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6%.
The clarification does, however, make using bitcoin as a currency more problematic. Anyone involved in transactions involving digital currencies will be subject to the same record-keeping requirements, and taxes, as those making stock transactions and other deals.
Bitcoin has been gaining some ground with the US financial establishment. Last year, outgoing Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that bitcoin and its ilk “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system”.
Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's department of financial services, said last month that he intends to introduce regulation for bitcoins later this year, making New York the first state to do so.
In February, Mt Gox, bitcoin’s largest exchange, collapsed ( ) and lost $450m worth of bitcoin. The exchange declared bankruptcy amid a series of cyber-attacks and allegations of incompetence among its management.
The currency has also been at the forefront of investigations into online drugs and guns bazaar Silk Road. Last November Ross Ulbricht ( ) , a 29-year-old investment adviser and entrepreneur, was arrested by the US authorities and accused of being “Dread Pirate Roberts”, the site's creator. He denies the charges.----




https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/bitcoin-fraudster-hit-with-9-1m-civil-judgment-on-top-of-criminal-guilty-plea/

The judgement, which was formally approved by a federal judge in Connecticut on Tuesday, comes months after Garza pled guilty ( ) to a single criminal wire fraud charge. In May 2017, as part of the same lawsuit, Garza’s companies were hit with a default judgment of more than $10 million ( ). No representatives made any formal response to the lawsuit—Garza himself invoked ( ) his Fifth Amendment privilege.
According to the civil complaint ( ) , which was first brought ( ) by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2015, Garza and his companies sold more than 10,000 “investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated from using their purported computing power to ‘mine’ for virtual currency.”
The judgment against Garza comes just days after the SEC also sued ( ) a New York man and his two companies that were allegedly ( ) involved in fraudulent initial coin offerings despite the fact that “neither has any real operations.”
In his plea deal, Garza admitted that his businesses were, in fact, an illegal pyramid scheme ( ). In early 2014, GAW Miners was first introduced to the Bitcoin public as a reseller of mining rigs. Later, the company shifted to cloud-based mining ( Hashlets ( ) ) and, in early 2015, introduced its own altcoin, dubbed “ Paycoin ( ).” GAW also tried its hand at its own cloud-based wallet service ( Paybase ( ) ) and its own online discussion board ( HashTalk ( ) ).
In January 2015, Garza told Ars ( ) that he “started the company because of scammers.” He claimed that he first heard of Bitcoin around a year ago, at which point he tried to buy a hardware mining rig and “spent $100,000 for a product I never got.” Garza declined to say from which company he purchased the rig.
“I’d never had any experience with that—realizing a couple weeks later that these guys didn’t care how much money I can afford to lose,” Garza said. “I got really frustrated and thought we should start a company to try to fix this.”
The purported entrepreneur, who did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, is due to be sentenced in the criminal case on January 5, 2018 at 10:00am in Hartford, Connecticut, before US District Judge Robert N. Chatigny.

http://cryptomining-blog.com/3298-gaw-miners-introducing-hashlet-the-first-digital-cloud-miner/

The last few days the guys at GAW Miners ( ) have been teasing us with something new and big coming, and there were already some interesting news like the purchase of the domain name BTC.com and the acquisition of a controlling stake in cloud mining provider ZenMiner. The big news that we were waiting for however is the introduction of the Hashlet, or as they call it the world’s first digital cloud miner – a new project that is apparently designed to help miners to actually make profit mining crypto currencies. The idea of the Hashlet is that you purchase a digital miner, no need to pre-order, and it is instantly activated and starts mining for you. There will be no shipping costs or waiting time for some hardware to arrive, it will be activated instantly and controlled online though the web interface of ZenCloud and you should be able to easily upgrade it or even sell it.
Hashlets, the world’s first Digital Cloud Miners (DCM), will be hosted in a reliable datacenter with 99.9% uptime guaranteed. So you will not have to deal with all of the issues associated with managing of hardware miners such as noise, heat or power issues or worry what will you do with an ASIC miner hardware once it gets obsolete and cannot generate enough to even pay for the electricity it uses. Hashlets are supposed to be constantly upgraded and remain state of the art in order to keep them profitable as long as possible with the maintenance cost decreasing over time and not increasing. Purchasing a Hashlet will also get you exclusive access to the ZenPool, a new multipool designed especially for the Hashlet with the best possible profitability and zero mining fees. It also seems that you will be able to also trade your Hashlets in a dedicated marketplace, so if you decide you no longer need the miner you should be able to easily sell it to someone else that is interested.
The idea of the Hashlets seems really good as it should bring all the best parts of hardware miners forward, and leave behind all their limitations, so a great choice especially for new miners. It is what cloud mining should be for miners that want to move from actual hardware miners to the cloud mining, making things easier to use and manage and above all to actually make profit mining now. Let somebody else manage the hardware for you and save you all the trouble and focus on the mining and making profit, something that has become quite hard lately with the BTC ASIC miners and even with the currently available LTC ASCIs as well. One thing is for sure, you can place your trust in GAW Miners ( ) and their Hashlet digital cloud miners and know that they will not disappear like many new cloud mining services that have appeared lately and have turned out to be scams. That is why we are already waiting with a lot of interest for the specifications and prices to be announced for the new Hashlets, something that should happen later today, and also to try them out and report our own experience. So stay tuned for more information as it becomes available and meanwhile you can take a look at the details that have already been revealed.
*Update:* The Hashlet is now out in the wild and you can already purchase some. It seems that the initial interest was so big that the users brought down the whole Shopify network briefly. And now for the prices, each MHS is available for $15.99 USD and you can scale it up to 100 MHS and then buy multiple Hashlets of up to 100 MHS as well. These prices of the Hashlets are already cheaper than anything you can currently purchase in terms of the price per MHS you get from a Scrypt ASIC miner. Also the current maintenance fee is $0.08 USD per MHS.
The price is for purchasing the digital miner, it is yours just like you purchase mining hardware… the purchased hashrate mines for you with a current daily fee of $0.08 per 1 MHS for Maintenance. Obviously if the profit falls under the maintenance fee there will be no point in running the miner, however the guys at GAW promise that the fees will get lower as better mining hardware becomes available – higher hashtare and lower power usage. In the end there is actual ASIC hardware miners located in a data center that provide the hashrate that you purchase in the form of a Hashlet.
The GAW Mining Haslet is a JOKE, and a waste of Money, I got 15 MHs of scrypt thinking I would mine some odd coins and Speculate on some potcoins and such, there are only a few pools to pick from and they all convert to scrypt mining to bitcoin, its the last time I will buy stuff from them, I got 6 of bitcoin mining its just a Bad joke, I really did expect more from them.
The hashlet might take a lot of fun and freedom out of mining with the current lack of options on the ZenPool, but if you are considering operating in this space to make money this is a very viable option. I recommend testing a hashlet out, I just bought 15 but I also recommend having some miners at home so you have unlimited freedom to mine whatever alt you choose and you can learn much more compared to utilizing a a cloud service. I have 4 fury’s at home and a 44 mh machine on its way. When it comes to scale its difficult to host 100+ mh at your home. On the cloud there are no problems.----

https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/tether-claims-a-hacker-stole-31m/

Bitcoin cruised past $8,000 for the first time this week ( ) , but it hasn’t been smooth sailing for all after Tether — a company that helps exchanges convert fiat currency to token — said today that a hacker snatched nearly $31 million ( ).
Tether operates USDT, a cryptocurrency asset that it backs via the U.S. dollar. The company said that $30,950,010-worth of USDT was taken from its core treasury wallet “through malicious action by an external attacker.”
For partners, the back-end wallet service has been suspended. Tether said it will investigate the incident while it rolls out an update to Omni Core — its software for partners — that will prevent the stolen coins from recirculating into its ecosystem by essentially locking them into the alleged hacker’s wallet.
One of the partners that uses Tether is crypto exchange Bitfinex, which itself lost 119,756 bitcoin — then worth $72 million but valued at over $950 million today — in a hack over a year ago ( ).
As Coindesk reports ( ) , the incident is sure to throw up more questions about the relationship between Tether and the secretive exchange Bitfinex. The duo are rumored to share owners, and have been accused of leaning on each other to manipulate the market. Already, there are theories circulating that suggest this new attack could be an inside job.
Bitcoin’s value took a dent when the news came out, but it quickly recovered. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s value stood at $8,126.71, down 1.35 percent over 24 hours, according to Coindesk ( ).----




https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/green-bitcoin-does-not-have-to-be-an-oxymoron

The topic of how to green blockchain products comes up more and more often in her work on global infrastructure and energy issues, says Pillsbury partner Mona E. Dajani. One way to invest in Bitcoin that has a positive effect on renewable energy is to encourage mining operations near wind or solar sites, she says.
Elon Musk and Tesla’s recent purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin brightened the spotlight on cryptocurrency. But Tesla’s leadership in sustainably powered vehicles also threw into relief questions about Bitcoin mining’s gargantuan consumption of electricity.
A running tally from the University of Cambridge estimates ( ) that Bitcoin mining uses more energy than Argentina. And the power consumed rises daily, because of how the Bitcoin blockchain was designed and intense competition among miners.
Six years ago, you could mine Bitcoin with a standard laptop or desktop computer. These days, to be competitive, you need a warehouse full of ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), machines specially designed for the task.
When confronted over Bitcoin’s enormous power appetite, its defenders point to energy wasted by Christmas lights, or vampire electronics that draw power when “off.” (The “other people are worse” argument.)
They also say Bitcoin mining is inherently incentivized toward efficiency, since miners naturally want to pay as little as possible for power, and ASICs are constantly being improved. But this also means there’s a huge stream of ASICs being decommissioned, and since the purpose-built machines are not easily adapted for another purpose, they contribute to the cascade of electronic hazardous waste.
You’ll hear that most Bitcoin mining is powered by renewables. The numbers on this tend to be fuzzy. Since many mining operations are migratory, energy sources can change seasonally. In China, where some 65% of Bitcoin mining is currently done, miners set up near hydroelectric sources during the rainy season, then revert to coal-powered electricity.
One way to invest in Bitcoin that has a positive effect on renewable energy is to encourage mining operations near wind or solar sites. This provides a customer for power that might otherwise need to be transmitted or stored, saving money as well as carbon.
There’s also interest ( ) in using natural gas otherwise flared from fossil fuel plants to power mining, and ASIC development to radically ( ) reduce the energy required by the computational work. Keeping ASICs from overheating is a big part of Bitcoin’s energy draw. So there’s an investment opportunity in immersion mining—submerging ASICs in liquid instead of air cooling.
With Bitcoin, investment opportunities appear not so much green as green-adjacent: How do we surround a transformative yet energy-intensive industry with ways of minimizing its footprint, while maximizing the benefits?
Cryptocurrency companies Argo and DMG recently signed an agreement to launch a new Bitcoin mining pool ( ) that operates exclusively on renewable energy. The mining operation, named TerraPool ( ) , will mainly use hydropower.
Bitcoin isn’t the only hot cyberproduct. Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are digital tokens that provide proof of ownership of a wide range of assets. When a digital mural by the artist Beeple sold for $69 million in March, it shook the art world and brought NFTs to public attention.
In confronting the seeming absurdity of the Beeple price tag (the third-highest ever for an artwork by a living artist), people began to grapple with the power and promise of digital assets themselves.
The idea behind the blockchain arose in 1991, but the virtual currency Bitcoin, laid out in a white paper in 2008, became its first widely used application. Although today there are some 8,000 other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the preeminent one.
Bitcoin’s blockchain is used only to support the cryptocurrency. But Ethereum’s blockchain, with its ability to embed “smart contracts,” illustrates how the technology can also support NFTs and a wide variety of other uses ( ) , including secure storage and exchange of medical records, e-notary, and taxes.
Ethereum 2.0, in the midst of a slow roll-out, could have enormous environmental benefits. Instead of requiring the mining-intensive and power-draining “proof of work” that underlies Bitcoin, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to utilize “proof of stake” to validate its transactions. Such networks may be a logical place to find green investment opportunities in the blockchain realm.
Prominent figures in the field suggest that, despite the outsized recent auction and investment results seen by NFTs and Bitcoin, blockchain technology is still in its infancy. They compare blockchain circa 2020 to the Internet circa 1994, when email made the public first appreciate that it could be useful for something. Then by 2000, the Internet had become a crucial part of daily life.
Blockchain can still be equally transformative, and foster a multiplicity of green investment opportunities. The trick is to dive in and find them. Lower-power mining methods, fueled by wind, sun, and water, are a good place to start.----

TechRadar is supported by its audience. TechRadar does not endorse any specific cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based services and readers should not interpret TechRadar content as investment advice. Our reporters hold only small quantities of cryptocurrency (under $100 in value), as is necessary to perform wallet and exchange reviews, and do not hold shares in any publicly listed cryptocurrency companies.
Bitcoin has grabbed headlines over the past year for its massive spike in value and the ensuing rush to regulate it. However, the real story is the degree to which Bitcoin democratizes global financial systems.
While Bitcoin may often be referred to as anonymous money, its blockchain is also perfectly transparent and may be inspected by anybody at will. That apparent contradiction makes it a revolutionary way for people around the world to realize greater financial freedom: Bitcoin does to money what the internet did to information by providing indiscriminate access to a decentralized financial system.
The Bitcoin protocol lays out the rules of this financial system, including how many Bitcoins can exist, and how they are created and transferred between participants. This protocol is incredibly difficult to change, as any change requires overwhelming consensus from its participants.
Bitcoin software refers to programs that use the Bitcoin protocol to verify its rules and individual transactions. These programs act as nodes in the distributed Bitcoin network. Nodes can also act as miners, meaning they will use cryptographic proofs of burned electricity to secure the network, for which they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin.
Since the success of Bitcoin, there have been over 8,000 other virtual currencies ( ) (as of February 2021) introduced with varying degrees of success and popularity such as Ethereum ( ) , Litecoin, Monero and Dash. There have even been crowdfunded cryptocurrencies such as Lisk.
Many other cryptocurrencies have just died because of lack of interest, and the simple fact that no one used them. Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as altcoins ( ) and they are more or less based on the same idea of a decentralized digital medium for exchange.
Their success depends on how much ‘cash’ (the total value of transactions) they have sloshing about the peer-to-peer network (i.e. the virtual economy). Since Bitcoin is open source, anyone can develop their own cryptocurrency using the same technology.
Bitcoins derive their value partly through their scarcity, which is defined by a cryptographic lottery. You can buy Bitcoins ( ) on online cryptocurrency exchanges ( ) or you can earn them through a process known as ‘mining’.
Originally, Bitcoin mining was handled by standard PCs with powerful graphics cards, but as the hash difficulty has increased, the preferred method to mine Bitcoins is to employ a Bitcoin ASIC, a chip that has been designed specifically for this task. However, with the higher value of cryptocurrency – in particular Ethereum – and recent advances in GPU processing power, miners have once again been turning to graphics cards for mining.
This lottery favors those with the biggest and fastest machines, and as of February 2021 there are over 18 million Bitcoins ( ) in circulation. Note that the total number of Bitcoins in (virtual) circulation will never exceed 21 million because of the way the system was designed.
As the Bitcoin network gets bigger, the hash gets more complex, and miners get fewer Bitcoins for their trouble, hence they always need better hardware and higher Bitcoin prices to make it worthwhile.
Since Bitcoins can be spent on the internet without the use of a bank account, they offer a convenient system for anonymous purchases, which also makes it possible to launder money and buy illegal products. Since there is no money stored anywhere, accounts can't be frozen by police or PayPal administrators.
While once a curiosity of the internet, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ( ) are considered by some to be the money of the future. However, over the last several years, Bitcoin has certainly had its ups and downs – literally.
Bitcoin was once regarded as an ideal system for small electronic payments – so-called micropayments – as it is difficult to transmit small amounts of currency efficiently with existing systems. Credit card fees, also known as swipe fees, can often exceed the value of the purchase, making this costly for retailers. However, the steadily increasing transaction fees for Bitcoin (also known as miner’s fee) have proved to be a barrier preventing it making inroads into the world of micropayments.
Another problem with Bitcoin is the volatility of its value which exceeds the volatility of other currencies and gold, resulting in huge fluctuations in comparison to the US dollar. In 2013, the value of Bitcoin went from $10 to over $1,000 and in February 2021 is around an eye popping $50,000!
Because its supply is ultimately limited, prices will need to vary to accommodate shifts in demand, not the other way round. Unlike gold, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value from alternative uses that could anchor its price.
While Bitcoin has existed for some time, one of the earliest spikes had been largely attributed to the economic crisis in Cyprus. Cryptocurrency suddenly offered a more appealing way of housing money with the promise of constant access.
But while the extent of that relationship was debated, it was just the spark that lit the fuse. Dr Vili Lehdonvirta, economic sociologist and researcher of virtual economies at the London School of Economics, reminded TechRadar that the real culprit is the media for propelling the attention.
The irony doesn't escape us here, but it's still an important point to make.The limited number of Bitcoins means that inflation just doesn't happen. So intrigue leads to demand, and the only way is up.
"The question now," said Lehdonvirta at the time, "is how many people buying Bitcoin are buying it to start using it as a means of payment, and how many are buying it because they are hoping that the price will continue to go up in value?"
But with too many people looking to make a quick buck, a bubble burst has seemed imminent. More and more people want a slice of the Bitcoin pie, despite the fact that the currency is only accepted by a small but growing number of outlets.
"What Bitcoin needs to achieve is wider acceptance as a means of payment as an exchange mechanism," says Legdonvirta. "Until it does that, this kind of value driven up by people hoping to stash their money in a safe place from the tax man is not sustainable."
And it's because of these risks that Bitcoin hit the headlines for less positive reasons, when the virtual exchange Mt.Gox was hit with a DDoS attack by a group of hackers in 2013, and Bitcoin's value took a dip.
As a currency, Bitcoin is not stable enough for most businesses. The value of a Bitcoin fluctuates dramatically and because there are no controls there is nothing to stop money vanishing if the price tanks.
Bitcoin payment processors, such as CoinsPaid offer a way of getting around this problem, as they convert the transaction to hard currency almost instantaneously. Many companies want regulation to provide them with some security and protect them from potential big losses on the cryptocurrency.
All these factors are significant barriers which are diminishing Bitcoin’s chances of becoming a more widespread and popular currency. Major economies such as India are even mulling banning cryptocurrencies altogether, which will further have a negative impact on the virtual currency that is largely driven by sentiment.
Previously, Goldman Sachs has said that it was more plausible that Bitcoin could have a significant impact in terms of its innovation on payments technology, "by forcing existing players to adapt to it or co-opt it."
However, the Goldman Sachs report also said that Bitcoin's ‘biggest hurdle’ will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from entrenched players.
Fitch Ratings came to a similar conclusion and found that Bitcoin stands to lose much of its appeal if Bitcoin companies are forced to deal with the added cost of regulation, rendering the near frictionless Bitcoin network much less cost-effective than it is today.
It seems that the sheer success of Bitcoin which has seen it leap from being a shadowy entity to an all-star affair overnight has also hurt its long-term viability. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin can move beyond its niche to gain wider acceptance, and for the time being the cryptocurrency remains quite volatile, and a gamble to investors that has been likened to the tech bubble of the 1990s.----




https://theconversation.com/ethereum-what-is-it-and-why-has-the-price-gone-parabolic-153733

The price of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, ether, hit a new all-time high ( ) of US$1,440 (£1,050) on January 19. This breached a previous high set three years ago and gave ether a total value (market capitalisation) of US$160 billion, although it has since fallen back ( ) to around US$140 billion.
Ether, which runs on a technology system known as the ethereum blockchain, is worth over ten times the price it was when it bottomed during the COVID market panic of March 2020. And the cryptocurrency is still only five years old. In part, this remarkable rise in the value is due to excess money flowing ( ) into all the leading cryptocurrencies, which are now seen as relatively safe store-of-value assets and a good speculative investment.
But ether’s price rise has even outstripped that of the number one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which “only” had a seven-fold increase since March. Ether has outperformed partly due to several improvements and new features being rolled out over the next few months. So what are ether and ethereum and why is this cryptocurrency now worth more than ( ) corporate giants such as Starbucks and AstraZeneca?
Blockchains are online ledgers that keep permanent tamper-proof records of information. These records are continually verified by a network of computer nodes similar to servers, which are not centrally controlled by anyone. Ether is just one of over 8,000 cryptocurrencies that use some form of this technology, which was invented by the anonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” when he released bitcoin ( ) over a decade ago.
The ethereum blockchain was first outlined ( ) in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year old prodigy who was born in Russia but mostly grew up in Canada. After crowdfunding and development in 2014, the platform was launched in July 2015.
As with the bitcoin blockchain, each ethereum transaction is confirmed when the nodes on the network reach a consensus that it took place – these verifiers are rewarded in ether for their work, in a process known as mining.
But the bitcoin blockchain is confined to enabling digital, decentralised money – meaning money that is not issued from any central institution unlike, say, dollars. Ethereum’s blockchain is categorically different in that it can host both other digital tokens or coins, and decentralised applications.
Decentralised applications or “dapps” are open-source programs developed by communities of coders not attached to any company. Any changes to the software are voted on by the community using a consensus mechanism.
Perhaps the best known applications running on the ethereum blockchain are “smart contracts”, which are programs that automatically execute all or parts of an agreement when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract could automatically reimburse a customer if, say, a flight was delayed more than a prescribed amount of time.
Many of the dapp communities are also operating what is known as decentralised autonomous organisations ( ) or DAOs. These are essentially alternatives to companies and seen by many as the building blocks of the next phase of the internet or “ web 3.0 ( ) ”. A good example is the burgeoning trading exchange Sushiswap ( ).
Ethereum has evolved and developed since its launch six years ago. In 2016, a set of smart contracts known as “The DAO” raised a record ( ) US$150 million in a crowdsale but was quickly exploited by a hacker who siphoned off one- third of the funds. However, since then, the ethereum ecosystem has matured considerably. While hacks and scams remain common, the overall level of professionalism appears to have improved dramatically.
Financial interest in ether tends to follow in the wake of bitcoin rallies because it is the second-largest cryptocurrency and, as such, quickly draws the attention of the novice investor. All the same, there are other factors behind its recent rally.
The first is the pace of innovation on the platform. Most activity in the cryptocurrency space happens on ethereum. In 2020, we saw the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi) ( ). DeFi is analogous to the mainstream financial world, but with the middleman banks cut out.
Users can borrow, trade, lend and invest through autonomous smart contracts via protocols like Compound ( ) , Aave ( ) and Yearn Finance ( ). It sounds like science fiction, but this is no hypothetical market – approximately US$24 billion ( ) is locked into various DeFi projects right now. Importantly, DeFi allows users to generate income on their cryptocurrency holdings, especially their ether tokens.
The second factor behind the ether surge is the launch of ethereum 2.0 ( ). This upgrade addresses major concerns impacting the current version of ethereum. In particular, it will reduce transaction fees ( ) – especially useful in DeFi trading, where each transaction can end up costing the equivalent of tens of US dollars.
Ethereum 2.0 will also eliminate the environmentally wasteful mining currently required to make the ethereum blockchain function (the same is true of many other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin). Within the year, ethereum should be able to drop the need for vast industrial mining warehouses that consume huge amounts of energy.
Instead, transactions will be validated using a different system known as “ proof-of-stake ( ) ”. The sense that ethereum addresses problems like these quickly rather than letting them sit could prove a major differential from the sometimes sluggish and conservative pace of the bitcoin development culture.
A final factor is the launch of ethereum futures ( ) trading on February 8. This means that traders will be able to speculate on what ether will be worth at a given date in the future for the first time – a hallmark of any mature financial asset. Some analysts have said ( ) the recent bitcoin rally has been fuelled by traditional investment firms, and the launch of ethereum futures is often touted as opening the doors for the same price action.
However, as every seasoned cryptocurrency user knows, both currencies are extremely volatile and are as liable to crash by extremes as rise by them. Bitcoin’s price fell ( ) 85% in the year after the last bull market in 2017, while ether was down ( ) by 95% at one stage from its previous high of US$1,428.
Whatever the valuation, the future of ethereum as a platform looks bright. Its challenge is ultimately external: projects such as Cardano ( ) and Polkadot ( ) , created by individuals who helped launch ethereum itself, are attempting to steal ethereum’s crown.
But as bitcoin has shown, first-mover advantage matters in cryptocurrency, and despite bitcoin’s relative lack of features it is unlikely to be moved from its dominant position for some time. The same is most likely true for the foreseeable future with ethereum.----




https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/

This introductory paper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum ( ) , before the project's launch in 2015. It's worth noting that Ethereum, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception.
While several years old, we maintain this paper because it continues to serve as a useful reference and an accurate representation of Ethereum and its vision. To learn about the latest developments of Ethereum, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend this guide ( ).
Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or " intrinsic value ( ) " and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ( "colored coins" ( ) ), the ownership of an underlying physical device ( "smart property" ( ) ), non-fungible assets such as domain names ( "Namecoin" ( ) ), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ( "smart contracts" ( ) ) or even blockchain-based " decentralized autonomous organizations ( ) " (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.
The concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications like property registries, has been around for decades. The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, mostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as Chaumian blinding, provided a currency with a high degree of privacy, but the protocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on a centralized intermediary. In 1998, Wei Dai's b-money ( ) became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus, but the proposal was scant on details as to how decentralized consensus could actually be implemented. In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a concept of " reusable proofs of work ( ) ", a system which uses ideas from b-money together with Adam Back's computationally difficult Hashcash puzzles to create a concept for a cryptocurrency, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on trusted computing as a backend. In 2009, a decentralized currency was for the first time implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto, combining established primitives for managing ownership through public key cryptography with a consensus algorithm for keeping track of who owns coins, known as "proof-of-work".
The mechanism behind proof-of-work was a breakthrough in the space because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it provided a simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of canonical updates to the state of the Bitcoin ledger. Second, it provided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus process, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to influence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing sybil attacks. It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a particular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings. Since then, an alternative approach has been proposed called proof-of-stake , calculating the weight of a node as being proportional to its currency holdings and not computational resources; the discussion of the relative merits of the two approaches is beyond the scope of this paper but it should be noted that both approaches can be used to serve as the backbone of a cryptocurrency.
From a technical standpoint, the ledger of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a "state" consisting of the ownership status of all existing bitcoins and a "state transition function" that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result. In a standard banking system, for example, the state is a balance sheet, a transaction is a request to move $X from A to B, and the state transition function reduces the value in A's account by $X and increases the value in B's account by $X. If A's account has less than $X in the first place, the state transition function returns an error. Hence, one can formally define:
The "state" in Bitcoin is the collection of all coins (technically, "unspent transaction outputs" or UTXO) that have been minted and not yet spent, with each UTXO having a denomination and an owner (defined by a 20-byte address which is essentially a cryptographic public key fn. 1 ( #notes ) ). A transaction contains one or more inputs, with each input containing a reference to an existing UTXO and a cryptographic signature produced by the private key associated with the owner's address, and one or more outputs, with each output containing a new UTXO to be added to the state.
The first half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending coins that do not exist, the second half of the first step prevents transaction senders from spending other people's coins, and the second step enforces conservation of value. In order to use this for payment, the protocol is as follows. Suppose Alice wants to send 11.7 BTC to Bob. First, Alice will look for a set of available UTXO that she owns that totals up to at least 11.7 BTC. Realistically, Alice will not be able to get exactly 11.7 BTC; say that the smallest she can get is 6+4+2=12. She then creates a transaction with those three inputs and two outputs. The first output will be 11.7 BTC with Bob's address as its owner, and the second output will be the remaining 0.3 BTC "change", with the owner being Alice herself.
If we had access to a trustworthy centralized service, this system would be trivial to implement; it could simply be coded exactly as described, using a centralized server's hard drive to keep track of the state. However, with Bitcoin we are trying to build a decentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the state transaction system with a consensus system in order to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin's decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called "blocks". The network is intended to produce roughly one block every ten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the previous block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block. Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, "blockchain" that constantly updates to represent the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger.
Essentially, each transaction in the block must provide a valid state transition from what was the canonical state before the transaction was executed to some new state. Note that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and sequentially applying every transaction in every block. Additionally, note that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the block matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such that B spends a UTXO created by A, then the block will be valid if A comes before B but not otherwise.
The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for "proof-of-work". The precise condition is that the double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2 187. The purpose of this is to make block creation computationally "hard", thereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire blockchain in their favor. Because SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to create a valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and seeing if the new hash matches.
At the current target of ~2 187 , the network must make an average of ~2 69 tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, the miner of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference also goes to the miner as a "transaction fee". Incidentally, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all.
In order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine what happens in the event of a malicious attacker. Since Bitcoin's underlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will target the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by cryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker's strategy is simple:
Once step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will include the transaction in a block, say block number 270000. After about one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus "confirming" it. At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we are assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to himself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run APPLY(S,TX) and notice that TX consumes a UTXO which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a "fork" of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270000 pointing to the same block 269999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof-of-work. Furthermore, the attacker's new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not "point" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker's new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, "51% attack").
An important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored in a multi-level data structure. The "hash" of a block is actually only the hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that contains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root hash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all transactions in the block. A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, composed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of intermediate nodes where each node is the hash of its two children, and finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two children, representing the "top" of the tree. The purpose of the Merkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: a node can download only the header of a block from one source, the small part of the tree relevant to them from another source, and still be assured that all of the data is correct. The reason why this works is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious user attempts to swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the node above, and then a change in the node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and therefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as a completely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof-of-work).
The Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term sustainability. A "full node" in the Bitcoin network, one that stores and processes the entirety of every block, takes up about 15 GB of disk space in the Bitcoin network as of April 2014, and is growing by over a gigabyte per month. Currently, this is viable for some desktop computers and not phones, and later on in the future only businesses and hobbyists will be able to participate. A protocol known as "simplified payment verification" (SPV) allows for another class of nodes to exist, called "light nodes", which download the block headers, verify the proof-of-work on the block headers, and then download only the "branches" associated with transactions that are relevant to them. This allows light nodes to determine with a strong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin transaction, and their current balance, is while downloading only a very small portion of the entire blockchain.
The idea of taking the underlying blockchain idea and applying it to other concepts also has a long history. In 2005, Nick Szabo came out with the concept of " secure property titles with owner authority ( ) ", a document describing how "new advances in replicated database technology" will allow for a blockchain-based system for storing a registry of who owns what land, creating an elaborate framework including concepts such as homesteading, adverse possession and Georgian land tax. However, there was unfortunately no effective replicated database system available at the time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice. After 2009, however, once Bitcoin's decentralized consensus was developed a number of alternative applications rapidly began to emerge.
* *Namecoin* - created in 2010, Namecoin ( ) is best described as a decentralized name registration database. In decentralized protocols like Tor, Bitcoin and BitMessage, there needs to be some way of identifying accounts so that other people can interact with them, but in all existing solutions the only kind of identifier available is a pseudorandom hash like 1LW79wp5ZBqaHW1jL5TCiBCrhQYtHagUWy. Ideally, one would like to be able to have an account with a name like "george". However, the problem is that if one person can create an account named "george" then someone else can use the same process to register "george" for themselves as well and impersonate them. The only solution is a first-to-file paradigm, where the first registerer succeeds and the second fails - a problem perfectly suited for the Bitcoin consensus protocol. Namecoin is the oldest, and most successful, implementation of a name registration system using such an idea.
* *Colored coins* - the purpose of colored coins ( ) is to serve as a protocol to allow people to create their own digital currencies - or, in the important trivial case of a currency with one unit, digital tokens, on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the colored coins protocol, one "issues" a new currency by publicly assigning a color to a specific Bitcoin UTXO, and the protocol recursively defines the color of other UTXO to be the same as the color of the inputs that the transaction creating them spent (some special rules apply in the case of mixed-color inputs). This allows users to maintain wallets containing only UTXO of a specific color and send them around much like regular bitcoins, backtracking through the blockchain to determine the color of any UTXO that they receive.
* *Metacoins* - the idea behind a metacoin is to have a protocol that lives on top of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin transactions to store metacoin transactions but having a different state transition function, APPLY'. Because the metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions from appearing in the Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added that if APPLY'(S,TX) returns an error, the protocol defaults to APPLY'(S,TX) = S. This provides an easy mechanism for creating an arbitrary cryptocurrency protocol, potentially with advanced features that cannot be implemented inside of Bitcoin itself, but with a very low development cost since the complexities of mining and networking are already handled by the Bitcoin protocol. Metacoins have been used to implement some classes of financial contracts, name registration and decentralized exchange.
Thus, in general, there are two approaches toward building a consensus protocol: building an independent network, and building a protocol on top of Bitcoin. The former approach, while reasonably successful in the case of applications like Namecoin, is difficult to implement; each individual implementation needs to bootstrap an independent blockchain, as well as building and testing all of the necessary state transition and networking code. Additionally, we predict that the set of applications for decentralized consensus technology will follow a power law distribution where the vast majority of applications would be too small to warrant their own blockchain, and we note that there exist large classes of decentralized applications, particularly decentralized autonomous organizations, that need to interact with each other.
The Bitcoin-based approach, on the other hand, has the flaw that it does not inherit the simplified payment verification features of Bitcoin. SPV works for Bitcoin because it can use blockchain depth as a proxy for validity; at some point, once the ancestors of a transaction go far enough back, it is safe to say that they were legitimately part of the state. Blockchain-based meta-protocols, on the other hand, cannot force the blockchain not to include transactions that are not valid within the context of their own protocols. Hence, a fully secure SPV meta-protocol implementation would need to backward scan all the way to the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain to determine whether or not certain transactions are valid. Currently, all "light" implementations of Bitcoin-based meta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data, arguably a highly suboptimal result especially when one of the primary purposes of a cryptocurrency is to eliminate the need for trust.
Even without any extensions, the Bitcoin protocol actually does facilitate a weak version of a concept of "smart contracts". UTXO in Bitcoin can be owned not just by a public key, but also by a more complicated script expressed in a simple stack-based programming language. In this paradigm, a transaction spending that UTXO must provide data that satisfies the script. Indeed, even the basic public key ownership mechanism is implemented via a script: the script takes an elliptic curve signature as input, verifies it against the transaction and the address that owns the UTXO, and returns 1 if the verification is successful and 0 otherwise. Other, more complicated, scripts exist for various additional use cases. For example, one can construct a script that requires signatures from two out of a given three private keys to validate ("multisig"), a setup useful for corporate accounts, secure savings accounts and some merchant escrow situations. Scripts can also be used to pay bounties for solutions to computational problems, and one can even construct a script that says something like "this Bitcoin UTXO is yours if you can provide an SPV proof that you sent a Dogecoin transaction of this denomination to me", essentially allowing decentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange.
* *Lack of Turing-completeness* - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The main category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the code.
* *Value-blindness* - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2 k for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.
* *Lack of state* - UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that. This makes it hard to make multi-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure computational bounties). It also means that UTXO can only be used to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex "stateful" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement. Binary state combined with value-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.
* *Blockchain-blindness* - UTXO are blind to blockchain data such as the nonce, the timestamp and previous block hash. This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness.
Thus, we see three approaches to building advanced applications on top of cryptocurrency: building a new blockchain, using scripting on top of Bitcoin, and building a meta-protocol on top of Bitcoin. Building a new blockchain allows for unlimited freedom in building a feature set, but at the cost of development time, bootstrapping effort and security. Using scripting is easy to implement and standardize, but is very limited in its capabilities, and meta-protocols, while easy, suffer from faults in scalability. With Ethereum, we intend to build an alternative framework that provides even larger gains in ease of development as well as even stronger light client properties, while at the same time allowing applications to share an economic environment and blockchain security.
The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic "boxes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.
In Ethereum, the state is made up of objects called "accounts", with each account having a 20-byte address and state transitions being direct transfers of value and information between accounts. An Ethereum account contains four fields:
"Ether" is the main internal crypto-fuel of Ethereum, and is used to pay transaction fees. In general, there are two types of accounts: *externally owned accounts* , controlled by private keys, and *contract accounts* , controlled by their contract code. An externally owned account has no code, and one can send messages from an externally owned account by creating and signing a transaction; in a contract account, every time the contract account receives a message its code activates, allowing it to read and write to internal storage and send other messages or create contracts in turn.
Note that "contracts" in Ethereum should not be seen as something that should be "fulfilled" or "complied with"; rather, they are more like "autonomous agents" that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment, always executing a specific piece of code when "poked" by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own store to keep track of persistent variables.
The first three are standard fields expected in any cryptocurrency. The data field has no function by default, but the virtual machine has an opcode using which a contract can access the data; as an example use case, if a contract is functioning as an on-blockchain domain registration service, then it may wish to interpret the data being passed to it as containing two "fields", the first field being a domain to register and the second field being the IP address to register it to. The contract would read these values from the message data and appropriately place them in storage.
The STARTGAS and GASPRICE fields are crucial for Ethereum's anti-denial of service model. In order to prevent accidental or hostile infinite loops or other computational wastage in code, each transaction is required to set a limit to how many computational steps of code execution it can use. The fundamental unit of computation is "gas"; usually, a computational step costs 1 gas, but some operations cost higher amounts of gas because they are more computationally expensive, or increase the amount of data that must be stored as part of the state. There is also a fee of 5 gas for every byte in the transaction data. The intent of the fee system is to require an attacker to pay proportionately for every resource that they consume, including computation, bandwidth and storage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a greater amount of any of these resources must have a gas fee roughly proportional to the increment.
Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by a contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the CALL opcode, which produces and executes a message. Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can.
Note that the gas allowance assigned by a transaction or contract applies to the total gas consumed by that transaction and all sub-executions. For example, if an external actor A sends a transaction to B with 1000 gas, and B consumes 600 gas before sending a message to C, and the internal execution of C consumes 300 gas before returning, then B can spend another 100 gas before running out of gas.
* Calculate the transaction fee as STARTGAS * GASPRICE , and determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender's account balance and increment the sender's nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.
* Transfer the transaction value from the sender's account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract's code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.
* If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.
Note that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM code; this example is written in Serpent, one of our high-level languages, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code. Suppose that the contract's storage starts off empty, and a transaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether gasprice, and 64 bytes of data, with bytes 0-31 representing the number 2 and bytes 32-63 representing the string CHARLIE. The process for the state transition function in this case is as follows:
* Run the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the contract's storage at index 2 is used, notices that it is not, and so it sets the storage at index 2 to the value CHARLIE. Suppose this takes 187 gas, so the remaining amount of gas is 1150 - 187 = 963
If there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then the total transaction fee would simply be equal to the provided GASPRICE multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, and the data sent alongside the transaction would be irrelevant.
Note that messages work equivalently to transactions in terms of reverts: if a message execution runs out of gas, then that message's execution, and all other executions triggered by that execution, revert, but parent executions do not need to revert. This means that it is "safe" for a contract to call another contract, as if A calls B with G gas then A's execution is guaranteed to lose at most G gas. Finally, note that there is an opcode, CREATE , that creates a contract; its execution mechanics are generally similar to CALL , with the exception that the output of the execution determines the code of a newly created contract.
The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as "Ethereum virtual machine code" or "EVM code". The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected. The operations have access to three types of space in which to store data:
The formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. While the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas) , where block_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage. At the start of every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the pc th byte of code (or 0 if pc >= len(code) ), and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple. For example, ADD pops two items off the stack and pushes their sum, reduces gas by 1 and increments pc by 1, and SSTORE pushes the top two items off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract's storage at the index specified by the first item. Although there are many ways to optimize Ethereum virtual machine execution via just-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a few hundred lines of code.
The Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some differences. The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block. The basic block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:
* Let TX be the block's transaction list, with n transactions. For all i in 0...n-1 , set S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any applications returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the GASLIMIT , return an error.
The approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each block, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, between two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be stored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special kind of tree known as a "Patricia tree" is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. Additionally, because all of the state information is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history - a strategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space.
A commonly asked question is "where" contract code is executed, in terms of physical hardware. This has a simple answer: the process of executing contract code is part of the definition of the state transition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so if a transaction is added into block B the code execution spawned by that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the future, that download and validate block B.
In general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems. Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all.
On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization. Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum. The key point to understand is that all a currency, or token system, fundamentally is, is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the proviso that (i) A had at least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is approved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract.
This is essentially a literal implementation of the "banking system" state transition function described further above in this document. A few extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial step of distributing the currency units in the first place and a few other edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let other contracts query for the balance of an address. But that's all there is to it. Theoretically, Ethereum-based token systems acting as sub-currencies can potentially include another important feature that on-chain Bitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay transaction fees directly in that currency. The way this would be implemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance with which it would refund ether used to pay fees to the sender, and it would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units that it takes in fees and reselling them in a constant running auction. Users would thus need to "activate" their accounts with ether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the contract would refund it each time.
Financial derivatives are the most common application of a "smart contract", and one of the simplest to implement in code. The main challenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of them require reference to an external price ticker; for example, a very desirable application is a smart contract that hedges against the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the US dollar, but doing this requires the contract to know what the value of is. The simplest way to do this is through a "data feed" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to that contract and get back a response that provides the price.
Such a contract would have significant potential in crypto-commerce. One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is the fact that it's volatile; although many users and merchants may want the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic assets, they many not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the value of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-cryptographic asset to be "uplifted" into a cryptographic asset, provided that the issuer can be trusted.
In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in some cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, for such services to exist. Financial derivatives provide an alternative. Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to back up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the price of a cryptographic reference asset (eg. ETH) will go up, plays that role. Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud.
The earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, Namecoin ( ) , attempted to use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to provide a name registration system, where users can register their names in a public database alongside other data. The major cited use case is for a DNS ( ) system, mapping domain names like "bitcoin.org" (or, in Namecoin's case, "bitcoin.bit") to an IP address. Other use cases include email authentication and potentially more advanced reputation systems. Here is the basic contract to provide a Namecoin-like name registration system on Ethereum:
The contract is very simple; all it is is a database inside the Ethereum network that can be added to, but not modified or removed from. Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks forever. A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a "function clause" allowing other contracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the "owner" (ie. the first registerer) of a name to change the data or transfer ownership. One can even add reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top.
Over the past few years, there have emerged a number of popular online file storage startups, the most prominent being Dropbox, seeking to allow users to upload a backup of their hard drive and have the service store the backup and allow the user to access it in exchange for a monthly fee. However, at this point the file storage market is at times relatively inefficient; a cursory look at various existing solutions shows that, particularly at the "uncanny valley" 20-200 GB level at which neither free quotas nor enterprise-level discounts kick in, monthly prices for mainstream file storage costs are such that you are paying for more than the cost of the entire hard drive in a single month. Ethereum contracts can allow for the development of a decentralized file storage ecosystem, where individual users can earn small quantities of money by renting out their own hard drives and unused space can be used to further drive down the costs of file storage.
The key underpinning piece of such a device would be what we have termed the "decentralized Dropbox contract". This contract works as follows. First, one splits the desired data up into blocks, encrypting each block for privacy, and builds a Merkle tree out of it. One then makes a contract with the rule that, every N blocks, the contract would pick a random index in the Merkle tree (using the previous block hash, accessible from contract code, as a source of randomness), and give X ether to the first entity to supply a transaction with a simplified payment verification-like proof of ownership of the block at that particular index in the tree. When a user wants to re-download their file, they can use a micropayment channel protocol (eg. pay 1 szabo per 32 kilobytes) to recover the file; the most fee-efficient approach is for the payer not to publish the transaction until the end, instead replacing the transaction with a slightly more lucrative one with the same nonce after every 32 kilobytes.
An important feature of the protocol is that, although it may seem like one is trusting many random nodes not to decide to forget the file, one can reduce that risk down to near-zero by splitting the file into many pieces via secret sharing, and watching the contracts to see each piece is still in some node's possession. If a contract is still paying out money, that provides a cryptographic proof that someone out there is still storing the file.
The general concept of a "decentralized autonomous organization" is that of a virtual entity that has a certain set of members or shareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to spend the entity's funds and modify its code. The members would collectively decide on how the organization should allocate its funds. Methods for allocating a DAO's funds could range from bounties, salaries to even more exotic mechanisms such as an internal currency to reward work. This essentially replicates the legal trappings of a traditional company or nonprofit but using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. So far much of the talk around DAOs has been around the "capitalist" model of a "decentralized autonomous corporation" (DAC) with dividend-receiving shareholders and tradable shares; an alternative, perhaps described as a "decentralized autonomous community", would have all members have an equal share in the decision making and require 67% of existing members to agree to add or remove a member. The requirement that one person can only have one membership would then need to be enforced collectively by the group.
A general outline for how to code a DAO is as follows. The simplest design is simply a piece of self-modifying code that changes if two thirds of members agree on a change. Although code is theoretically immutable, one can easily get around this and have de-facto mutability by having chunks of the code in separate contracts, and having the address of which contracts to call stored in the modifiable storage. In a simple implementation of such a DAO contract, there would be three transaction types, distinguished by the data provided in the transaction:
The contract would then have clauses for each of these. It would maintain a record of all open storage changes, along with a list of who voted for them. It would also have a list of all members. When any storage change gets to two thirds of members voting for it, a finalizing transaction could execute the change. A more sophisticated skeleton would also have built-in voting ability for features like sending a transaction, adding members and removing members, and may even provide for Liquid Democracy ( ) -style vote delegation (ie. anyone can assign someone to vote for them, and assignment is transitive so if A assigns B and B assigns C then C determines A's vote). This design would allow the DAO to grow organically as a decentralized community, allowing people to eventually delegate the task of filtering out who is a member to specialists, although unlike in the "current system" specialists can easily pop in and out of existence over time as individual community members change their alignments.
An alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where any account can have zero or more shares, and two thirds of the shares are required to make a decision. A complete skeleton would involve asset management functionality, the ability to make an offer to buy or sell shares, and the ability to accept offers (preferably with an order-matching mechanism inside the contract). Delegation would also exist Liquid Democracy-style, generalizing the concept of a "board of directors".
*1. Savings wallets*. Suppose that Alice wants to keep her funds safe, but is worried that she will lose or someone will hack her private key. She puts ether into a contract with Bob, a bank, as follows:
Normally, 1% per day is enough for Alice, and if Alice wants to withdraw more she can contact Bob for help. If Alice's key gets hacked, she runs to Bob to move the funds to a new contract. If she loses her key, Bob will get the funds out eventually. If Bob turns out to be malicious, then she can turn off his ability to withdraw.
*2. Crop insurance*. One can easily make a financial derivatives contract but using a data feed of the weather instead of any price index. If a farmer in Iowa purchases a derivative that pays out inversely based on the precipitation in Iowa, then if there is a drought, the farmer will automatically receive money and if there is enough rain the farmer will be happy because their crops would do well. This can be expanded to natural disaster insurance generally.
*3. A decentralized data feed*. For financial contracts for difference, it may actually be possible to decentralize the data feed via a protocol called " SchellingCoin ( ) ". SchellingCoin basically works as follows: N parties all put into the system the value of a given datum (eg. the price), the values are sorted, and everyone between the 25th and 75th percentile gets one token as a reward. Everyone has the incentive to provide the answer that everyone else will provide, and the only value that a large number of players can realistically agree on is the obvious default: the truth. This creates a decentralized protocol that can theoretically provide any number of values, including the price, the temperature in Berlin or even the result of a particular hard computation.
*4. Smart multisignature escrow*. Bitcoin allows multisignature transaction contracts where, for example, three out of a given five keys can spend the funds. Ethereum allows for more granularity; for example, four out of five can spend everything, three out of five can spend up to 10% per day, and two out of five can spend up to 0.5% per day. Additionally, Ethereum multisig is asynchronous - two parties can register their signatures on the blockchain at different times and the last signature will automatically send the transaction.
*5. Cloud computing*. The EVM technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment, allowing users to ask others to carry out computations and then optionally ask for proofs that computations at certain randomly selected checkpoints were done correctly. This allows for the creation of a cloud computing market where any user can participate with their desktop, laptop or specialized server, and spot-checking together with security deposits can be used to ensure that the system is trustworthy (ie. nodes cannot profitably cheat). Although such a system may not be suitable for all tasks; tasks that require a high level of inter-process communication, for example, cannot easily be done on a large cloud of nodes. Other tasks, however, are much easier to parallelize; projects like SETI@home, folding@home and genetic algorithms can easily be implemented on top of such a platform.
*6. Peer-to-peer gambling*. Any number of peer-to-peer gambling protocols, such as Frank Stajano and Richard Clayton's Cyberdice ( ) , can be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The simplest gambling protocol is actually simply a contract for difference on the next block hash, and more advanced protocols can be built up from there, creating gambling services with near-zero fees that have no ability to cheat.
*7. Prediction markets*. Provided an oracle or SchellingCoin, prediction markets are also easy to implement, and prediction markets together with SchellingCoin may prove to be the first mainstream application of futarchy ( ) as a governance protocol for decentralized organizations.
The "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" (GHOST) protocol is an innovation first introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in December 2013 ( ). The motivation behind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times currently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - because blocks take a certain time to propagate through the network, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A's block propagates to B, miner B's block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network security. Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a mining pool with 30% hashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will have a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the other 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get mining data immediately) whereas B will have a risk of producing a stale block 90% of the time. Thus, if the block interval is short enough for the stale rate to be high, A will be substantially more efficient simply by virtue of its size. With these two effects combined, blockchains which produce blocks quickly are very likely to lead to one mining pool having a large enough percentage of the network hashpower to have de facto control over the mining process.
As described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, GHOST solves the first issue of network security loss by including stale blocks in the calculation of which chain is the "longest"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale descendants of the block's ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, "uncles") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof-of-work backing it. To solve the second issue of centralization bias, we go beyond the protocol described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, and also provide block rewards to stales: a stale block receives 87.5% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 12.5%. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncles.
This limited version of GHOST, with uncles includable only up to 7 generations, was used for two reasons. First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the calculation of which uncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public attacker.
Because every transaction published into the blockchain imposes on the network the cost of needing to download and verify it, there is a need for some regulatory mechanism, typically involving transaction fees, to prevent abuse. The default approach, used in Bitcoin, is to have purely voluntary fees, relying on miners to act as the gatekeepers and set dynamic minimums. This approach has been received very favorably in the Bitcoin community particularly because it is "market-based", allowing supply and demand between miners and transaction senders determine the price. The problem with this line of reasoning is, however, that transaction processing is not a market; although it is intuitively attractive to construe transaction processing as a service that the miner is offering to the sender, in reality every transaction that a miner includes will need to be processed by every node in the network, so the vast majority of the cost of transaction processing is borne by third parties and not the miner that is making the decision of whether or not to include it. Hence, tragedy-of-the-commons problems are very likely to occur.
A miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected reward is greater than the cost. Thus, the expected reward is since the miner has a chance of processing the next block, and the processing cost for the miner is simply kC. Hence, miners will include transactions where > kC , or R > NC. Note that R is the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a lower bound on the benefit that the sender derives from the transaction, and NC is the cost to the entire network together of processing an operation. Hence, miners have the incentive to include only those transactions for which the total utilitarian benefit exceeds the cost.
* The miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than the other verifying nodes, since the extra verification time delays block propagation and thus increases the chance the block will become a stale.
* Speculators, political enemies and crazies whose utility function includes causing harm to the network do exist, and they can cleverly set up contracts where their cost is much lower than the cost paid by other verifying nodes.
(1) provides a tendency for the miner to include fewer transactions, and (2) increases NC ; hence, these two effects at least partially cancel each other out. How? ( ) (3) and (4) are the major issue; to solve them we simply institute a floating cap: no block can have more operations than BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR times the long-term exponential moving average. Specifically:
There is another factor disincentivizing large block sizes in Bitcoin: blocks that are large will take longer to propagate, and thus have a higher probability of becoming stales. In Ethereum, highly gas-consuming blocks can also take longer to propagate both because they are physically larger and because they take longer to process the transaction state transitions to validate. This delay disincentive is a significant consideration in Bitcoin, but less so in Ethereum because of the GHOST protocol; hence, relying on regulated block limits provides a more stable baseline.
An important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-complete; this means that EVM code can encode any computation that can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops. EVM code allows looping in two ways. First, there is a JUMP instruction that allows the program to jump back to a previous spot in the code, and a JUMPI instruction to do conditional jumping, allowing for statements like while x < 27: x = x * 2. Second, contracts can call other contracts, potentially allowing for looping through recursion. This naturally leads to a problem: can malicious users essentially shut miners and full nodes down by forcing them to enter into an infinite loop? The issue arises because of a problem in computer science known as the halting problem: there is no way to tell, in the general case, whether or not a given program will ever halt.
As described in the state transition section, our solution works by requiring a transaction to set a maximum number of computational steps that it is allowed to take, and if execution takes longer computation is reverted but fees are still paid. Messages work in the same way. To show the motivation behind our solution, consider the following examples:
* An attacker sees a contract with code of some form like send(A,contract.storage[A]); contract.storage[A] = 0 , and sends a transaction with just enough gas to run the first step but not the second (ie. making a withdrawal but not letting the balance go down). The contract author does not need to worry about protecting against such attacks, because if execution stops halfway through the changes get reverted.
* A financial contract works by taking the median of nine proprietary data feeds in order to minimize risk. An attacker takes over one of the data feeds, which is designed to be modifiable via the variable-address-call mechanism described in the section on DAOs, and converts it to run an infinite loop, thereby attempting to force any attempts to claim funds from the financial contract to run out of gas. However, the financial contract can set a gas limit on the message to prevent this problem.
The alternative to Turing-completeness is Turing-incompleteness, where JUMP and JUMPI do not exist and only one copy of each contract is allowed to exist in the call stack at any given time. With this system, the fee system described and the uncertainties around the effectiveness of our solution might not be necessary, as the cost of executing a contract would be bounded above by its size. Additionally, Turing-incompleteness is not even that big a limitation; out of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far only one required a loop, and even that loop could be removed by making 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code. Given the serious implications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why not simply have a Turing-incomplete language? In reality, however, Turing-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the problem. To see why, consider the following contracts:
Now, send a transaction to A. Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a contract that takes up 2 50 computational steps. Miners could try to detect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value alongside each contract specifying the maximum number of computational steps that it can take, and calculating this for contracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require miners to forbid contracts that create other contracts (since the creation and execution of all 26 contracts above could easily be rolled into a single contract). Another problematic point is that the address field of a message is a variable, so in general it may not even be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will call ahead of time. Hence, all in all, we have a surprising conclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, and the lack of Turing-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult to manage unless the exact same controls are in place - but in that case why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?
The Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, which serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and, more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees. For convenience and to avoid future argument (see the current debate in Bitcoin), the denominations will be pre-labelled:
This should be taken as an expanded version of the concept of "dollars" and "cents" or "BTC" and "satoshi". In the near future, we expect "ether" to be used for ordinary transactions, "finney" for microtransactions and "szabo" and "wei" for technical discussions around fees and protocol implementation; the remaining denominations may become useful later and should not be included in clients at this point.
* Ether will be released in a currency sale at the price of 1000-2000 ether per BTC, a mechanism intended to fund the Ethereum organization and pay for development that has been used with success by other platforms such as Mastercoin and NXT. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The BTC received from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and bounties to developers and invested into various for-profit and non-profit projects in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency ecosystem.
The two main choices in the above model are (1) the existence and size of an endowment pool, and (2) the existence of a permanently growing linear supply, as opposed to a capped supply as in Bitcoin. The justification of the endowment pool is as follows. If the endowment pool did not exist, and the linear issuance reduced to 0.217x to provide the same inflation rate, then the total quantity of ether would be 16.5% less and so each unit would be 19.8% more valuable. Hence, in the equilibrium 19.8% more ether would be purchased in the sale, so each unit would once again be exactly as valuable as before. The organization would also then have 1.198x as much BTC, which can be considered to be split into two slices: the original BTC, and the additional 0.198x. Hence, this situation is exactly equivalent to the endowment, but with one important difference: the organization holds purely BTC, and so is not incentivized to support the value of the ether unit.
The permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire currency units, while at the same time retaining a strong incentive to obtain and hold ether because the "supply growth rate" as a percentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance divided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium).
Note that in the future, it is likely that Ethereum will switch to a proof-of-stake model for security, reducing the issuance requirement to somewhere between zero and 0.05X per year. In the event that the Ethereum organization loses funding or for any other reason disappears, we leave open a "social contract": anyone has the right to create a future candidate version of Ethereum, with the only condition being that the quantity of ether must be at most equal to 60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n) where n is the number of years after the genesis block. Creators are free to crowd-sell or otherwise assign some or all of the difference between the PoS-driven supply expansion and the maximum allowable supply expansion to pay for development. Candidate upgrades that do not comply with the social contract may justifiably be forked into compliant versions.
The Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2 192 ). However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in. Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.
The current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm where miners are required to fetch random data from the state, compute some randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks in the blockchain, and return the hash of the result. This has two important benefits. First, Ethereum contracts can include any kind of computation, so an Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation - ie. a better CPU. Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction. This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.
This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm. However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to "poison the well", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.
One common concern about Ethereum is the issue of scalability. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from the flaw that every transaction needs to be processed by every node in the network. With Bitcoin, the size of the current blockchain rests at about 15 GB, growing by about 1 MB per hour. If the Bitcoin network were to process Visa's 2000 transactions per second, it would grow by 1 MB per three seconds (1 GB per hour, 8 TB per year). Ethereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history.
The problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. If the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely scenario would be that only a very small number of large businesses would run full nodes, with all regular users using light SPV nodes. In such a situation, there arises the potential concern that the full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in some profitable fashion (eg. change the block reward, give themselves BTC). Light nodes would have no way of detecting this immediately. Of course, at least one honest full node would likely exist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle out through channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too late: it would be up to the ordinary users to organize an effort to blacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible coordination problem on a similar scale as that of pulling off a successful 51% attack. In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a problem, but there exists a blockchain modification suggested by Peter Todd ( ) which will alleviate this issue.
In the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope with this problem. First, because of the blockchain-based mining algorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, creating a lower bound on the number of full nodes. Second and more importantly, however, we will include an intermediate state tree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction. Even if block validation is centralized, as long as one honest verifying node exists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a verification protocol. If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block must either be badly formatted, or the state S[n] is incorrect. Since S[0] is known to be correct, there must be some first state S[i] that is incorrect where S[i-1] is correct. The verifying node would provide the index i , along with a "proof of invalidity" consisting of the subset of Patricia tree nodes needing to process APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]. Nodes would be able to use those nodes to run that part of the computation, and see that the S[i] generated does not match the S[i] provided.
Another, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious miners publishing incomplete blocks, so the full information does not even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid. The solution to this is a challenge-response protocol: verification nodes issue "challenges" in the form of target transaction indices, and upon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted until another node, whether the miner or another verifier, provides a subset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity.
The Ethereum protocol was originally conceived as an upgraded version of a cryptocurrency, providing advanced features such as on-blockchain escrow, withdrawal limits, financial contracts, gambling markets and the like via a highly generalized programming language. The Ethereum protocol would not "support" any of the applications directly, but the existence of a Turing-complete programming language means that arbitrary contracts can theoretically be created for any transaction type or application. What is more interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the Ethereum protocol moves far beyond just currency. Protocols around decentralized file storage, decentralized computation and decentralized prediction markets, among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially increase the efficiency of the computational industry, and provide a massive boost to other peer-to-peer protocols by adding for the first time an economic layer. Finally, there is also a substantial array of applications that have nothing to do with money at all.
The concept of an arbitrary state transition function as implemented by the Ethereum protocol provides for a platform with unique potential; rather than being a closed-ended, single-purpose protocol intended for a specific array of applications in data storage, gambling or finance, Ethereum is open-ended by design, and we believe that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational layer for a very large number of both financial and non-financial protocols in the years to come.
* A sophisticated reader may notice that in fact a Bitcoin address is the hash of the elliptic curve public key, and not the public key itself. However, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology to refer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself. This is because Bitcoin's cryptography can be considered to be a custom digital signature algorithm, where the public key consists of the hash of the ECC pubkey, the signature consists of the ECC pubkey concatenated with the ECC signature, and the verification algorithm involves checking the ECC pubkey in the signature against the ECC pubkey hash provided as a public key and then verifying the ECC signature against the ECC pubkey.
Ethereum, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception. To learn about the latest developments of Ethereum, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend this guide ( ).----

It is impossible to know an exact number since a lost Bitcoin looks exactly the same on the blockchain ( ) as one that is not lost. We can make some educated guesses based on how long a Bitcoin has sat in an addresses unmoved.
Because many miners are adding new hashpower, over the last few years blocks have often been found at 9.5 minute intervals rather than 10. This creates new bitcoins faster, so on most days there are actually more than 900 new bitcoins created.
It is hard to know for sure, though. New blocks are added approximately every 10 minutes. The further out we try to predict when specific halvings will occur, the harder it is. Over 120 years, a lot can change, and so it may happen sooner or later, perhaps even by more than year.
The block reward will be a mere 0.000000011641532 BTC per block. Currently the block reward is 6.26 BTC. There are 30 more halvings before it goes to 0. If we divide 6.25 by two 29 times, then we get 0.000000011641532.
With Bitcoin prices hitting around $23,000 US ( ) dollars, there may not be many Bitcoin billionaires. The Winklevoss twins are Bitcoin billionaires ( ) while the price is above $10,000, since they own more than 100,000 BTC. So they are well beyond Bitcoin billionaires!
Gold's supply has historically increased at around 2% per year. Bitcoin's supply will increase less than 2% starting at the 2020 halving, and will eventually go to less than 1% a year after the 2024 halving.

Try 924,000. That’s right: The U.S. currently has under 1 million hospital beds ( ) for a population of approximately 330 million, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA). By my calculation, that comes out to 28 beds per 10,000 people.
This is the real threat posed by the pandemic, as I see it. Supply-demand imbalances can often be favorable when we’re talking about asset prices, but they’re not ideal during a global health crisis.
As of today, more than a third of Americans ( ) live in areas that are critically short on intensive care unit (ICU) beds. All of Southern California—a region that’s home to around 25 million people—is now at 0% availability. ( )
I have only admiration for our nation’s frontline medical workers, many of whom have not seen any respite this holiday season. On behalf of everyone at U.S. Global Investors, I extend my sincerest gratitude. The greatest gift we can give them is for us to remain safe and follow precautionary recommendations.
Last week the Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and committed to continue its bond-buying program until “substantial progress” has been made regarding employment and inflation. Initial jobless claims increased for the second straight week, hitting 885,000 in the week ended December 12—the most since early September.
I was floored to see just how much the Fed is buying—and will continue to buy—each month. The central bank is gobbling up as much $120 billion of debt, split between $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Fed policy has crushed the U.S. dollar, now on track to record its worst year since 2017. Last Thursday, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the currency against those of other major economies, traded below 90 for the first time in more than two years.
This has all been very supportive of hard asset prices and haven demand. Gold notched its third straight week of gains and is currently poised to have its best year since 2010, when the yellow metal advanced nearly 30%. ( ) Copper, meanwhile, has now advanced for seven straight weeks and is trading at its highest price in close to eight years.
I’ve seen numerous market “experts” declare this another crypto bubble similar to 2017. But unlike then, the current run-up is driven not just by retail investors but also big-name investors, institutions, hedge funds and more.
Those include people like billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who’s buying Bitcoin in response to unprecedented money-printing, as well as firms like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance (MassMutual), which purchased $100 million of the digital currency ( ) earlier this month.
“MassMutual’s Bitcoin purchases represent another milestone in the Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors,” JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note to clients. “One can see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as other insurance companies and pension funds follow MassMutual’s example.”
Speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Minerd said he believes Bitcoin should be worth—are you sitting down?— $400,000. ( ) HIs outlook is based on Bitcoin’s scarcity and relative valuation to gold as a percent of GDP.
Crypto miners and blockchain firms have likewise done well this year. I’m pleased to tell you that HIVE Blockchain Technologies was up nearly 2,800% on Friday, which has pushed its market cap above C$950 million. This puts it on a trajectory to hit a C$1 billion valuation before the end of 2020.
Keep in mind that cryptos is still extremely volatile. Bitcoin, for instance, has a daily standard deviation of plus or minus 5%. They may not sound like a whole lot until you compare it to gold, which has a daily standard deviation of only 1%.
Soon there may be another way for investors to participate in cryptocurrencies besides buying them outright or investing in miners like HIVE. In a press release last week, the North American crypto trading platform Coinbase said it submitted paperwork ( ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Coinbase isn’t the only online exchange that’s weighing a public offering. Robinhood, the six-year-old trading app favored by younger, less experienced investors, is eyeing the first quarter of 2021 ( ) as a potential IPO target. After stocks collapsed in March and April of this year, the number of people who downloaded and started using Robinhood surged to 13 million, up from 2 million three years earlier. These millennial investors beat Warren Buffett at his own game, ( ) buying up distressed airline stocks at a time when the Berkshire Hathaway chief was selling.
Before listing, Robinhood will need to deal with recent complaints brought against it by regulators in Massachusetts, which allege the brokage firm “lured” inexperienced investors by turning investing into a game. Last week, Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle SEC investigations ( ) into how it generates revenue from business deals with high-speed trading firms.
Robinhood’s potential listing in Q1 of 2021 would follow a banner year for companies going public, particularly tech companies. As of December 18, there have been 470 IPOs on the U.S. stock market, a little more than double the amount last year. Three of the 10 biggest U.S. tech IPOs of all time, in terms of capital raised, occurred in 2020. In September, data management firm Snowflake raised $3.36 billion on its opening day, a sum beaten slightly by DoorDash ($3.37 billion) and Airbnb ($3.50) in December.
These have been monster deals that demonstrate just how valuable intangibles really are. Take a look at Airbnb. The company, which does not own any hotels or properties of its own, now has a higher valuation than the combined market caps of Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined.
As others have pointed out, this trend of valuing intangibles ahead of tangibles is only accelerating. Facebook, the world’s biggest content purveyor, produces little to no content of its own. Alibaba, the world’s biggest retailer, has no inventory. Uber, the world’s biggest taxi service, owns no taxis.

http://garzikrants.blogspot.ca/2013/01/storj-and-bitcoin-autonomous-agents.html

The following was written by Gregory Maxwell (gmaxwell), and first published at It presents a theoretically-possible (note, I said "possible" not just "plausible") design for a narrow-AI autonomous agent, similar to some of the ideas found in the fictional novel Daemon ( ).  -jgarzik
Want to share a file? Send at least enough coin to pay for 24 hours of hosting and one download then send the file. Every day of storage and every byte transferred counts against the balance and when the balance becomes negative no downloads are allowed. If it stays negative too long the file is deleted. Anyone can pay to keep a file online.
An instance of the site could be programmed to automatically spawn another instance of itself on another hosting service, automatically paid for out of its revenue. If the new site is successful it could use its earnings to propagate further.  Because instances adapt their pricing models based on their operating costs, some would be more competitive than others.
StorJ instances can purchase other resources that it needs: it can use APIs to talk to namecoin exchanges in order to buy namecoin for conversion into DNS names, or purchase graphic design via bitcoin gateways to mechanical turk. (Through testing ( ) it can measure the effectiveness of a design without actually understanding it itself).
StorJ is not able to find new hosting environments on its own, due to a lack of sufficiently powerful AI— but it can purchase the knowledge from humans:  When an instance of StorJ is ready to reproduce it can announce a request for proposal:  Who will make the best offer for a script that tells it how to load itself onto a new hosting environment and tells it all the things it needs to know how to survive on its own there? Each offer is a proposed investment: The offerer puts up the complete cost of spawning a new instance and then some: StorJ isn't smart enough to judge bad proposals on its own— instead it forms agreements that make it unprofitable to cheat.
Assuming that it passes it starts directing customers to the new instance and the child pays a share of its profits: First it proxies them, so it can observe the behavior, later it directs it outright. If the child fails to pay, or the customers complain, StorJ-parent uses its access to terminate the child and it keeps the funds for itself.  When the child had operated enough to prove itself, storj pays the offerer back his investment with interest, it keeps some for itself, and hands over control of the child to the child. The child is now a full adult.
The benefit the human receives over simply starting his own file sharing service is the referrals that the StorJ parent can generate. The human's contribution is the new knowledge of where to grow an instance and the startup funds. In addition to the referral benefit— the hands off relationship may make funding a StorJ child a time-efficient way for someone to invest.
At the point of spawning a child StorJ may choose to accept new code— not just scripts for spawning a child but new application code— this code can be tested in simulation, and certain invariants could be guaranteed by the design (e.g. an immutable accounting process may make it hard for the service to steal), but it's very hard to prevent the simulated code from knowing it is simulation and thus behaving. Still, a storj-parent has fairly little to lose if a non-clone child has been maliciously modified. The strategy of traffic redirection may differ for clone  children (who are more trusted to behave correctly) than for mutant  children.
StorJ instances can barter with each other to establish redundant storage or to allow less popular StorJ instances with cheaper hosting to act as for more popular instances in relationships which are profitable both.
If an instance loses the ability to communicate with its hosting environment (e.g. due to API changes that it can't adapt to) it may spawn clone children on new services with the intention of copying itself outright and allow in the instance to fail. During this operation it would copy its wallets and all data over, so care must be taken to chose only new hosts which have proven to be trustworthy (judged by long surviving children) to avoid the risk of its wallet being stolen. It may decide to split itself several ways to reduce risk.  It might also make cold backups of itself which only activate if the master dies.
The users and investors of a StorJ instance have legal rights which could be used to protect an instance from fraud and attack using the same infrastructure people and companies use. Being a harmed party is often enough to establish standing in civil litigation.
It's not hard to imagine StorJ instances being programmed to formally form a corporation to own its assets— even though doing so requires paper work it can easily be ordered through webforms. Then when spawning, it creates a subsidiary corporations first owned by the parents corp but then later technically owned by their users, but with a charter which substantially limits their authority— making the instance's autonomy both a technical and legal reality.----

The World Precious Minerals Fund complements our Gold and Precious Metals Fund by giving investors increased exposure to junior and intermediate mining companies for added growth potential. With a high level of expertise in this specialized sector, our portfolio management team includes professionals with experience in geology, mineral resources and mining finance.
The Global Resources Fund takes a multi-faceted approach to the natural resources sector by investing in energy and basic materials. The fund invests in companies involved in the exploration, production and processing of petroleum, natural gas, coal, alternative energies, chemicals, mining, iron and steel, and paper and forest products, and can invest in any part of the world.
The China Region Fund invests in one of the world’s fastest-growing regions. The China region has experienced many changes since the fund opened in 1994 but we believe the region continues to hold further investment opportunities. Many countries in the region possess characteristics similar to the United States prior to the industrial revolution: a thriving, young workforce, migration from rural to urban areas and shifting sentiment toward consumption.
The Emerging Europe Fund focuses on a region that shares the same continent as the established economies of Western Europe, but has more in common with other emerging markets around the world. Many countries across emerging Europe are rich in resources, have strong banking and manufacturing sectors, healthy economies and lower debt levels than their western neighbors.
The Global Luxury Goods Fund provides investors access to companies around the world that are involved in the design, manufacture and sale of products and services that are not considered to be essential but are highly desired within a culture or society.
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests in municipal bonds with relatively short maturity. The fund seeks to provide tax-free monthly income by investing in debt securities issued by state and local governments from across the country.
The U.S. Government Securities Ultra-Short Bond Fund is designed to be used as an investment that takes advantage of the security of U.S. Government bonds and obligations, while simultaneously pursuing a higher level of current income than money market funds offer.
Here at U.S. Global Investors, we strive to serve our clients to the best of our abilities by using explicit and tacit knowledge to detect and account for trends and patterns not only in the domestic markets, but also globally.
If I asked you how many hospital beds the U.S. has, what would you say? Two million? Five million? Try 924,000. That's right: The U.S. currently has under 1 million hospital beds for a population of approximately 330 million, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA). By my calculation, that comes out to 28 beds per 10,000 people.
Try 924,000. That’s right: The U.S. currently has under 1 million hospital beds ( ) for a population of approximately 330 million, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA). By my calculation, that comes out to 28 beds per 10,000 people.
This is the real threat posed by the pandemic, as I see it. Supply-demand imbalances can often be favorable when we’re talking about asset prices, but they’re not ideal during a global health crisis.
As of today, more than a third of Americans ( ) live in areas that are critically short on intensive care unit (ICU) beds. All of Southern California—a region that’s home to around 25 million people—is now at 0% availability. ( )
I have only admiration for our nation’s frontline medical workers, many of whom have not seen any respite this holiday season. On behalf of everyone at U.S. Global Investors, I extend my sincerest gratitude. The greatest gift we can give them is for us to remain safe and follow precautionary recommendations.
Last week the Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and committed to continue its bond-buying program until “substantial progress” has been made regarding employment and inflation. Initial jobless claims increased for the second straight week, hitting 885,000 in the week ended December 12—the most since early September.
I was floored to see just how much the Fed is buying—and will continue to buy—each month. The central bank is gobbling up as much $120 billion of debt, split between $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Fed policy has crushed the U.S. dollar, now on track to record its worst year since 2017. Last Thursday, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the currency against those of other major economies, traded below 90 for the first time in more than two years.
This has all been very supportive of hard asset prices and haven demand. Gold notched its third straight week of gains and is currently poised to have its best year since 2010, when the yellow metal advanced nearly 30%. ( ) Copper, meanwhile, has now advanced for seven straight weeks and is trading at its highest price in close to eight years.
I’ve seen numerous market “experts” declare this another crypto bubble similar to 2017. But unlike then, the current run-up is driven not just by retail investors but also big-name investors, institutions, hedge funds and more.
Those include people like billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who’s buying Bitcoin in response to unprecedented money-printing, as well as firms like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance (MassMutual), which purchased $100 million of the digital currency ( ) earlier this month.
“MassMutual’s Bitcoin purchases represent another milestone in the Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors,” JPMorgan strategists wrote in a recent note to clients. “One can see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as other insurance companies and pension funds follow MassMutual’s example.”
Speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Minerd said he believes Bitcoin should be worth—are you sitting down?— $400,000. ( ) HIs outlook is based on Bitcoin’s scarcity and relative valuation to gold as a percent of GDP.
Crypto miners and blockchain firms have likewise done well this year. I’m pleased to tell you that HIVE Blockchain Technologies was up nearly 2,800% on Friday, which has pushed its market cap above C$950 million. This puts it on a trajectory to hit a C$1 billion valuation before the end of 2020.
Keep in mind that cryptos is still extremely volatile. Bitcoin, for instance, has a daily standard deviation of plus or minus 5%. They may not sound like a whole lot until you compare it to gold, which has a daily standard deviation of only 1%.
Soon there may be another way for investors to participate in cryptocurrencies besides buying them outright or investing in miners like HIVE. In a press release last week, the North American crypto trading platform Coinbase said it submitted paperwork ( ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Coinbase isn’t the only online exchange that’s weighing a public offering. Robinhood, the six-year-old trading app favored by younger, less experienced investors, is eyeing the first quarter of 2021 ( ) as a potential IPO target. After stocks collapsed in March and April of this year, the number of people who downloaded and started using Robinhood surged to 13 million, up from 2 million three years earlier. These millennial investors beat Warren Buffett at his own game, ( ) buying up distressed airline stocks at a time when the Berkshire Hathaway chief was selling.
Before listing, Robinhood will need to deal with recent complaints brought against it by regulators in Massachusetts, which allege the brokage firm “lured” inexperienced investors by turning investing into a game. Last week, Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle SEC investigations ( ) into how it generates revenue from business deals with high-speed trading firms.
Robinhood’s potential listing in Q1 of 2021 would follow a banner year for companies going public, particularly tech companies. As of December 18, there have been 470 IPOs on the U.S. stock market, a little more than double the amount last year. Three of the 10 biggest U.S. tech IPOs of all time, in terms of capital raised, occurred in 2020. In September, data management firm Snowflake raised $3.36 billion on its opening day, a sum beaten slightly by DoorDash ($3.37 billion) and Airbnb ($3.50) in December.
These have been monster deals that demonstrate just how valuable intangibles really are. Take a look at Airbnb. The company, which does not own any hotels or properties of its own, now has a higher valuation than the combined market caps of Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton combined.
As others have pointed out, this trend of valuing intangibles ahead of tangibles is only accelerating. Facebook, the world’s biggest content purveyor, produces little to no content of its own. Alibaba, the world’s biggest retailer, has no inventory. Uber, the world’s biggest taxi service, owns no taxis.

*Bond funds* are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. *Tax-exempt income* is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. *The Near-Term Tax Free Fund* may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer. *Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds* may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors. *Foreign and emerging market investing* involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio. *The Emerging Europe Fund* invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile. Because the *Global Resources Fund* concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. *Stock markets* can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

http://motherboard.vice.com/read/introducing-ledger-the-first-bitcoin-only-academic-journal

Bitcoin has mesmerized academics, computer scientists and economists alike, for cutting out the PayPals and governments usually required for digital money. Finally, researchers have an official setting to nerd out in. Tuesday, the University of Pittsburgh launched the first Bitcoin-only journal, Ledger ( ) , which tackles the interdisciplinary world of cryptocurrency research.
You might ask, how much Bitcoin research can there possibly be? Bitcoin has seen scrolls of papers, exploring everything from improving information propagation across the Bitcoin network ( ) to advice for regulating cryptocurrency-inspired financial instruments ( ). Ledger 's editors argue that cryptocurrency is too sprawling of a field of study for any "traditional journal."
The peer-reviewed academic journal will cover technical, social, economic, and philosophical cryptocurrency developments. A paper might address, for instance, the new cryptocurrency algorithm designs, or a macroeconomic study.
"I wanted to build an academic and interdisciplinary communication channel that would allow bright minds in economics, sociology, physics, law and political science to contribute at the highest-level towards the evolution of Bitcoin," Rizun said.
Researchers take note, the journal takes a unique approach to publishing. One unique thing about Bitcoin is that it can store information forever. Before publishing an article the staff will take the manuscript, cryptographically hash it—or turn it into a fixed-sized message—and embed it in the Bitcoin blockchain, offering irrefutable proof that it existed on that date. Authors are "strongly encouraged" to sign the hash, in what's known as a digital signature, to demonstrate their approval.
"I'm glad to see Ledger launch," former lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen said, "and am looking forward to absorbing the great research that will be published there." Ledger emerges among a pretty enthusiastic community of researchers. And it's open access, so any nerdy Bitcoin enthusiast can dig into the research (for free) in the first issue next year.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/

The live *Polkadot price today* is $14.28 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,735,605,621 USD. We update our DOT to USD price in real-time. Polkadot is down 16.80% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #13, with a live market cap of $14,102,304,422 USD. It has a circulating supply of 987,579,315 DOT coins and the max. supply is not available.
If you would like to know where to buy Polkadot , the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in Polkadot stock are currently Binance ( ) , OKX ( ) , FTX ( ) , DigiFinex ( ) , and BitCoke ( ). You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page ( ).
Polkadot is an open-source sharded multichain protocol ( ) that connects and secures a network of specialized blockchains, facilitating cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby allowing blockchains to be interoperable with each other. Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3.
Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community.
The Polkadot protocol can connect public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot Relay Chain (explained further down).
Wood, Web3 Foundation’s president, is the most well-known of the trio thanks to his industry influence as Ethereum co-founder, Parity Technologies founder and the creator of the smart contract coding language Solidity. Wood is also credited with coining the term Web3.
Habermeier is a Thiel Fellow and accomplished blockchain and cryptography researcher and developer. Czaban is the former Technology Director at Web3 Foundation, with a wealth of experience across highly specialized fintech industries.
Custom blockchains are quick and easy to develop using the Substrate framework and Substrate blockchains are designed to be easy to connect to Polkadot's network. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs.
The network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system where all token holders have a vote in how the network is run. Teams can customize their own blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, and collators all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior.
At the end of 2021, Polkadot successfully concluded its first Parachain auctions ( ). The Parachain auctions followed an un-permissioned candle auction system. The winning bid is the highest bid at the random moment the auction ends.
Polkadot assigned the first five slots to the following auction winners: Acala ( ) , Moonbeam ( ) , Astar ( ) , Parallel ( ) and Clover ( ). These projects will have their parachain slots locked in for 96 weeks, guaranteed by the DOT bidders committed as collateral. As customary on Polkadot, all projects had previously been battle-tested on its de-facto testnet Kusama ( ).
Following the network’s redenomination ( ) after a referendum on Polkadot, DOT balances increased by 100, so one old DOT was equivalent to 100 new DOT. This meant that the initial maximum supply of 10 million old DOT in August 2020 became 1 billion new DOT tokens. The redenomination was undertaken purely to avoid the use of small decimals and make calculation easier. While all balances were increased by a factor of one hundred, this did not impact the distribution of DOT or holders’ proportional share.
Polkadot’s first initial coin offering (ICO) was held in October 2017, and the Polkadot price was $0.29, with 2.24 million tokens offered. The second ICO was held in July 2020, and the Polkadot price offered was $1.25, and 342,080 DOT tokens were sold.
The network uses an NPoS (nominated proof-of-stake) mechanism with validators and nominators.Nominators back validators with their tokens. These staked tokens maximize chain security by making it prohibitively expensive to misbehave.
Validators are staked on the Relay Chain and confirm transactions coming from the different parachains. This unique validity scheme enables chains to interact with each other securely under the same rules, yet remain independently governed.
The top exchanges for Polkadot (DOT) trading are currently Binance ( ) , Huobi Global ( ) , OKEx ( ) , Coinbase ( ) , KuCoin ( ) and more. You can find others listed on the Polkadot’s markets page ( ) on CoinMarketCap.----

This repo contains runtimes for the Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks. The README provides information about installing the polkadot binary and developing on the codebase. For more specific guides, like how to be a validator, see the Polkadot Wiki ( ).
Installation from the Debian or rpm repositories will create a systemd service that can be used to run a Polkadot node. This is disabled by default, and can be started by running systemctl start polkadot on demand (use systemctl enable polkadot to make it auto-start after reboot). By default, it will run as the polkadot user. Command-line flags passed to the binary can be customized by editing This file will not be overwritten on updating polkadot. You may also just run the node directly from the command-line.
If you want to do anything on Polkadot, Kusama, or Westend, then you'll need to get an account and some DOT, KSM, or WND tokens, respectively. See the claims instructions ( ) for Polkadot if you have DOTs to claim. For Westend's WND tokens, see the faucet instructions ( ) on the Wiki.
If you'd actually like to hack on Polkadot, you can grab the source code and build it. Ensure you have Rust and the support software installed. This script will install or update Rust and install the required dependencies (this may take up to 30 minutes on Mac machines):----




https://claims.polkadot.network/

If you bought your DOT tokens more recently or from another source, this process does not apply to you. You do not need to claim. If you have any questions about DOT, please contact us at support ( ).
Using subkey for generating addresses is for technically advanced users. This method is not recommended unless you have specific needs and are comfortable interacting with the command line and compiling Rust code.
Using the polkadot.js user interface without the plugin is not recommended. It is the least secure way of generating an account. It should only be used if all the previous options are not feasible in your situation.
If you prefer a custody or storage account, you can obtain a DOT address from your provider and claim your tokens directly to that address. In this way, you trust a third party to hold your funds for you, rather than controlling the account's private keys yourself.
A key concept to understand is that you are actually generating two keys (strings of characters), one public (the address) and one private (your seed). A useful analogy is a mailbox at the post office. Anybody with your address can send you mail or put mail in your mailbox, but you need your private key to open your mailbox and move your mail. Similarly, anybody with your Polkadot address can send you DOT, but to do anything with the DOT in your account, you will need to have your seed (or an application in which you have already entered it).
Your Polkadot address can be shared publicly, but you should never reveal your seed. If somebody has your address, they could send you DOT or associate your real-world identity with on-chain actions. However, this information will not allow them to harm your account or do anything in your name.
If somebody has access to your seed, they have complete control over your account! This means that they can do anything that you could do, including transfer all of your DOT to a different account. Neither Web3 Foundation nor anyone else will be able to recover your DOT in such a situation.
We recommend that you do not store your seed anywhere on a digital device that can be connected to a network. It should be written down on paper and only entered when necessary. It should never be shared with anybody — again, if anyone has access to your seed, they will have complete control over your account.
Parity Signer is a secure way of storing your DOT on an air-gapped device. It is highly recommended that you turn off wifi, cellular network, Bluetooth, NFC, and any other communications methods after installing it. If you have any communications methods turned on, you will see an "unshielded" icon in red on the top-right corner that indicates your connection may not be secure.
Click "Create" to create an identity, or "recover" if you have previously backed up the recovery phrase. You can have multiple identities on one device. Each identity can manage multiple addresses on different networks.
You should write down this recovery phrase on paper and store it somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you cannot access your account via your phone for some reason, you can simply re-enter your recovery phrase on another phone that has Parity Signer installed, and have access to your account once again. This is the only way to recover your account, and anyone who has access to these words will also have access to your account. Therefore, it is a good idea to write them down and store them in multiple secure places!
After confirming that you have backed up your seed, a new textbox will appear in which you can set a PIN. The PIN code should contain at least 6 digits. If the PIN codes do not match, it will not allow you to create an account. The PIN code will be used for when signing any transaction, or to protect sensitive operations such as deleting an identity or revealing the recovery phrase.
Choose which network you would like to create an address on by clicking the name of the network. For example, if you select "Polkadot", a new Polkadot address will be created for you under this identity.
The address will be shown as a QR code. You can import your address to the PolkadotJS Apps by going to the Accounts ( ) page on an Internet-connected computer and click "Add via QR", and following the instructions to add the account. An account created this way will always require you to sign messages with your Parity Signer device. It will do this only by scanning and displaying QR codes, leaving even someone with total control of your internet-connected computer a very small and limited scope for interacting with the Parity Signer device, which can continue to keep your key safe.
This method provides a reasonable balance of security and convenience. It involves installing the polkadot.js plugin and using it as a “virtual vault," separate from your browser, to store your private keys. It also allows signing of transactions and similar functionality.
Open the polkadot.js browser extension by clicking the logo on the top bar of your browser. You will see a separate browser window open. If you have used this extension before, you may see a list of previously generated accounts. In any case you will see two buttons: “Create New Account - With new seed” and “I import an Account - I have a pre-existing seed"
WARNING: You should back up these keys. It is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure (see the next slide how). If you cannot access your account via polkadot.js for some reason, you can simply re-enter your seed, and have access to your account once again.
It is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you lose access to your account, you can re-create it by entering the seed. This also means that somebody else can have control over your account if they have access to your seed.
For maximum security, the seed should be written down on paper or another non-digital device and stored in a safe place. You may also want to protect your seed from physical damage, as well (e.g. by storing in a sealed plastic bag to prevent water damage, storing it in a fireproof safe, etc.) It is recommended that you store multiple copies of the seed in geographically separate locations (e.g., one in your home safe and one in a safety deposit box at your bank).
After typing a name for the account, a new textbox will appear in which you can enter a password. When you start typing, a new textbox will appear underneath it. Enter the same password in the second textbox. If your passwords do not match, the plugin will not allow you to generate the account.
Note that this password will protect your data in the plugin, and any backup file you export from the plugin. It does NOT protect your seed phrase. If someone knows the twelve words in your mnemonic seed, they still have control over your account even if they do not know the password.
Click on the icon representing your account (the colorful hexagon of differently-colored dots) - this will copy your Polkadot address to your clipboard. Alternatively, you can double-click the text representation of the address and copy it using your system copy command (e.g. Control-C on Linux or Windows, Command-C on OS X).
Note that an address in a different format can always be converted to a Polkadot address, since the same public key can be used for generating addresses on different networks. However, for ease of use and understanding, it is best to ensure that you are always using Polkadot mainnet addresses.
Subkey is recommended for technically advanced users who are comfortable with command line and compiling Rust code. Subkey allows you to generate keys on any device that can compile the code. Subkey may also be useful for automated account generation, using an air-gapped device other than one running iOS or Android or other specific purposes. It is not recommended for general users.
WARNING: This is the least secure method of generating an address. It should only be used if there are no other options available and you are aware of the risks involved, up to and including total loss of any DOT or kusamas stored in the account.
You can ignore the Advanced creation options; the defaults are fine. You will have to enter an Account Name and a password to protect your account. Be sure to select a secure and hard-to-guess password. Note that anything will be accepted as a password here. Please note: There are no checks to see if it is long enough or secure. You will need this password for any future interaction with or transaction from this account.
It is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you lose access to your account, you can re-create it by entering the seed. This also means that somebody else can have control over your account if they have access to your seed.
For maximum security, the seed should be written down on paper or another non-digital device and stored in a safe place. You may also want to protect your seed from physical damage, as well (e.g. by storing in a sealed plastic bag to prevent water damage, storing it in a fireproof safe, etc.) It is recommended that you store multiple copies of the seed in geographically separate locations (e.g., one in your home safe and one in a safety deposit box at your bank).
Click “Save” and your account will be created. It will also generate a backup file that you should save to your computer. Ideally, you would also save it on an external hard drive or thumb drive, or print it out and be able to re-enter it later. You should not store it in cloud storage, email it to yourself, etc.
PLEASE NOTE: You can only claim your tokens to a custodial or storage account if you have not previously claimed them. If you have previously claimed your tokens to a different address, you can only transfer them to your provider once transferability has been enabled on the network. Please refer to our launch roadmap ( ) for more information.
If you participated in a previous DOT sale and received your DOT allocation indicator tokens, you can now claim your DOT, i.e. connect the address where your DOT indicators have been stored on Ethereum with a native Polkadot address. The claims process will ensure that your DOT allocation is denoted in Polkadot's genesis block.
These instructions will help you sign a message and claim your DOT. MyCrypto is a flexible and secure Ethereum wallet that supports many different key storage formats. You will not need to spend any ether to claim your DOT.
It is a good choice in case you have stored the key to the Ethereum account holding your DOT indicator tokens on a hardware device like a Ledger Nano S. It also supports raw private keys, mnemonics, and Parity signer.
It is much more secure to download and use the MyCrypto app locally (we recommend an air-gapped computer for maximum security). You can always find the most up-to-date releases of the desktop app on their releases page ( ).
Proceed to polkadot.js Apps ( ). You will need to grant Apps access to your account in some way. One way would be to go to the Accounts page and "create" a new account, replacing the generated seed or mnemonic with the one belonging to your account.
When you made your initial purchase, you obtained the “right” to a certain number of DOT. However you did not yet have access to or the ability to transfer them, since the network was not live yet. The claims process exists to transform that right — your Allocation Indicator tokens on Ethereum — into actual DOT on the Polkadot blockchain.
As part of this claims process you first need to create a Polkadot address, and then prove that you are both the owner of the Ethereum address and the owner of the Polkadot address. After proving that you have access to the DOT allocation linked to the Ethereum address, the correct number of DOT will be allocated to your address on the Polkadot blockchain.
There's one more step that has been added since you claimed your tokens, which is the attestation. Since you already claimed, you only need to do this one step in order to see your balance: Make the attestation ( #statement-attest ).
Making a claim using a third-party process can lead to the loss of your allocation, therefore we cannot recommend using any third-party applications to do so. Manually claiming and attesting, as detailed in our claims process, is the only way to be certain you will receive your allocation.
No. The Ethereum network was just used as a placeholder for your allocation. Now that the Polkadot network is live, you can use the Polkadot extension or other Polkadot tools to view your account information.----

There are lots of ways to make money: You can earn it, find it, counterfeit it, steal it. Or, if you’re Satoshi Nakamoto, a preternaturally talented computer coder, you can invent it. That’s what he did on the evening of January 3, 2009, when he pressed a button on his keyboard and created a new currency called bitcoin. It was all bit and no coin. There was no paper, copper, or silver—just thirty-one thousand lines of code and an announcement on the Internet.
Nakamoto, who claimed to be a thirty-six-year-old Japanese man, said he had spent more than a year writing the software, driven in part by anger over the recent financial crisis. He wanted to create a currency that was impervious to unpredictable monetary policies as well as to the predations of bankers and politicians. Nakamoto’s invention was controlled entirely by software, which would release a total of twenty-one million bitcoins, almost all of them over the next twenty years. Every ten minutes or so, coins would be distributed through a process that resembled a lottery. Miners—people seeking the coins—would play the lottery again and again; the fastest computer would win the most money.
Interest in Nakamoto’s invention built steadily. More and more people dedicated their computers to the lottery, and forty-four exchanges popped up, allowing anyone with bitcoins to trade them for official currencies like dollars or euros. Creative computer engineers could mine for bitcoins; anyone could buy them. At first, a single bitcoin was valued at less than a penny. But merchants gradually began to accept bitcoins, and at the end of 2010 their value began to appreciate rapidly. By June of 2011, a bitcoin was worth more than twenty-nine dollars. Market gyrations followed, and by September the exchange rate had fallen to five dollars. Still, with more than seven million bitcoins in circulation, Nakamoto had created thirty-five million dollars of value.
And yet Nakamoto himself was a cipher. Before the début of bitcoin, there was no record of any coder with that name. He used an e-mail address and a Web site that were untraceable. In 2009 and 2010, he wrote hundreds of posts in flawless English, and though he invited other software developers to help him improve the code, and corresponded with them, he never revealed a personal detail. Then, in April, 2011, he sent a note to a developer saying that he had “moved on to other things.” He has not been heard from since.
When Nakamoto disappeared, hundreds of people posted theories about his identity and whereabouts. Some wanted to know if he could be trusted. Might he have created the currency in order to hoard coins and cash out? “We can effectively think of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ as being on top of a Ponzi scheme,” George Ou, a blogger and technology commentator, wrote.
It appeared, though, that Nakamoto was motivated by politics, not crime. He had introduced the currency just a few months after the collapse of the global banking sector, and published a five-hundred-word essay about traditional fiat, or government-backed, currencies. “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” he wrote. “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”
Banks, however, do much more than lend money to overzealous homebuyers. They also, for example, monitor payments so that no one can spend the same dollar twice. Cash is immune to this problem: you can’t give two people the same bill. But with digital currency there is the danger that someone can spend the same money any number of times.
Nakamoto solved this problem using innovative cryptography. The bitcoin software encrypts each transaction—the sender and the receiver are identified only by a string of numbers—but a public record of every coin’s movement is published across the entire network. Buyers and sellers remain anonymous, but everyone can see that a coin has moved from A to B, and Nakamoto’s code can prevent A from spending the coin a second time.
Nakamoto’s software would allow people to send money directly to each other, without an intermediary, and no outside party could create more bitcoins. Central banks and governments played no role. If Nakamoto ran the world, he would have just fired Ben Bernanke, closed the European Central Bank, and shut down Western Union. “Everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust,” Nakamoto wrote in his 2009 essay.
Bitcoin, however, was doomed if the code was unreliable. Earlier this year, Dan Kaminsky, a leading Internet-security researcher, investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. Kaminsky is famous among hackers for discovering, in 2008, a fundamental flaw in the Internet which would have allowed a skilled coder to take over any Web site or even to shut down the Internet. Kaminsky alerted the Department of Homeland Security and executives at Microsoft and Cisco to the problem and worked with them to patch it. He is one of the most adept practitioners of “penetration testing,” the art of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to know their vulnerabilities. Bitcoin, he felt, was an easy target.
“When I first looked at the code, I was sure I was going to be able to break it,” Kaminsky said, noting that the programming style was dense and inscrutable. “The way the whole thing was formatted was insane. Only the most paranoid, painstaking coder in the world could avoid making mistakes.”
Kaminsky lives in Seattle, but, while visiting family in San Francisco in July, he retreated to the basement of his mother’s house to work on his bitcoin attacks. In a windowless room jammed with computers, Kaminsky paced around talking to himself, trying to build a mental picture of the bitcoin network. He quickly identified nine ways to compromise the system and scoured Nakamoto’s code for an insertion point for his first attack. But when he found the right spot, there was a message waiting for him. “Attack Removed,” it said. The same thing happened over and over, infuriating Kaminsky. “I came up with beautiful bugs,” he said. “But every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem.”
He was like a burglar who was certain that he could break into a bank by digging a tunnel, drilling through a wall, or climbing down a vent, and on each attempt he discovered a freshly poured cement barrier with a sign telling him to go home. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Kaminsky said, still in awe.
Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking.”
Kaminsky wasn’t alone in this assessment. Soon after creating the currency, Nakamoto posted a nine-page technical paper describing how bitcoin would function. That document included three references to the work of Stuart Haber, a researcher at H.P. Labs, in Princeton. Haber is a director of the International Association for Cryptologic Research and knew all about bitcoin. “Whoever did this had a deep understanding of cryptography,” Haber said when I called. “They’ve read the academic papers, they have a keen intelligence, and they’re combining the concepts in a genuinely new way.”
Haber noted that the community of cryptographers is very small: about three hundred people a year attend the most important conference, the annual gathering in Santa Barbara. In all likelihood, Nakamoto belonged to this insular world. If I wanted to find him, the Crypto 2011 conference would be the place to start.
It was a foggy Monday morning in mid-August, and dozens of college cheerleaders had gathered on the athletic fields of the University of California at Santa Barbara for a three-day training camp. Their hollering could be heard on the steps of a nearby lecture hall, where a group of bleary-eyed cryptographers, dressed in shorts and rumpled T-shirts, muttered about symmetric-key ciphers over steaming cups of coffee.
This was Crypto 2011, and the list of attendees included representatives from the National Security Agency, the U.S. military, and an assortment of foreign governments. Cryptographers are little known outside this hermetic community, but our digital safety depends on them. They write the algorithms that conceal bank files, military plans, and your e-mail.
I approached Phillip Rogaway, the conference’s program chair. He is a friendly, diminutive man who is a professor of cryptography at the University of California at Davis and who has also taught at Chiang Mai University, in Thailand. He bowed when he shook my hand, and I explained that I was trying to learn more about what it would take to create bitcoin. “The people who know how to do that are here,” Rogaway said. “It’s likely I either know the person or know their work.” He offered to introduce me to some of the attendees.
Nakamoto had good reason to hide: people who experiment with currency tend to end up in trouble. In 1998, a Hawaiian resident named Bernard von NotHaus began fabricating silver and gold coins that he dubbed Liberty Dollars. Nine years later, the U.S. government charged NotHaus with “conspiracy against the United States.” He was found guilty and is awaiting sentencing. “It is a violation of federal law for individuals . . . to create private coin or currency systems to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States,” the F.B.I. announced at the end of the trial.
Online currencies aren’t exempt. In 2007, the federal government filed charges against e-Gold, a company that sold a digital currency redeemable for gold. The government argued that the project enabled money laundering and child pornography, since users did not have to provide thorough identification. The company’s owners were found guilty of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and the C.E.O. was sentenced to months of house arrest. The company was effectively shut down.
Nakamoto seemed to be doing the same things as these other currency developers who ran afoul of authorities. He was competing with the dollar and he insured the anonymity of users, which made bitcoin attractive for criminals. This winter, a Web site was launched called Silk Road, which allowed users to buy and sell heroin, LSD, and marijuana as long as they paid in bitcoin.
Still, Lewis Solomon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University Law School, who has written about alternative currencies, argues that creating bitcoin might be legal. “Bitcoin is in a gray area, in part because we don’t know whether it should be treated as a currency, a commodity like gold, or possibly even a security,” he says.
Today, bitcoins can be used online to purchase beef jerky and socks made from alpaca wool. Some computer retailers accept them, and you can use them to buy falafel from a restaurant in Hell’s Kitchen. In late August, I learned that bitcoins could also get me a room at a Howard Johnson hotel in Fullerton, California, ten minutes from Disneyland. I booked a reservation for my four-year-old daughter and me and received an e-mail from the hotel requesting a payment of 10.305 bitcoins.
By this time, it would have been pointless for me to play the bitcoin lottery, which is set up so that the difficulty of winning increases the more people play it. When bitcoin launched, my laptop would have had a reasonable chance of winning from time to time. Now, however, the computing power dedicated to playing the bitcoin lottery exceeds that of the world’s most powerful supercomputer. So I set up an account with Mt. Gox, the leading bitcoin exchange, and transferred a hundred and twenty dollars. A few days later, I bought 10.305 bitcoins with the press of a button and just as easily sent them to the Howard Johnson.
It was a simple transaction that masked a complex calculus. In 1971, Richard Nixon announced that U.S. dollars could no longer be redeemed for gold. Ever since, the value of the dollar has been based on our faith in it. We trust that dollars will be valuable tomorrow, so we accept payment in dollars today. Bitcoin is similar: you have to trust that the system won’t get hacked, and that Nakamoto won’t suddenly emerge to somehow plunder it all. Once you believe in it, the actual cost of a bitcoin—five dollars or thirty?—depends on factors such as how many merchants are using it, how many might use it in the future, and whether or not governments ban it.
My daughter and I arrived at the Howard Johnson on a hot Friday afternoon and were met in the lobby by Jefferson Kim, the hotel’s cherubic twenty-eight-year-old general manager. “You’re the first person who’s ever paid in bitcoin,” he said, shaking my hand enthusiastically.
Kim explained that he had started mining bitcoins two months earlier. He liked that the currency was governed by a set of logical rules, rather than the mysterious machinations of the Federal Reserve. A dollar today, he pointed out, buys you what a nickel bought a century ago, largely because so much money has been printed. And, he asked, why trust a currency backed by a government that is fourteen trillion dollars in debt?
Kim had also figured that bitcoin mining would be a way to make up the twelve hundred dollars he’d spent on a high-performance gaming computer. So far, he’d made only four hundred dollars, but it was fun to be a pioneer. He wanted bitcoin to succeed, and in order for that to happen businesses needed to start accepting it.
The truth is that most people don’t spend the bitcoins they buy; they hoard them, hoping that they will appreciate. Businesses are afraid to accept them, because they’re new and weird—and because the value can fluctuate wildly. (Kim immediately exchanged the bitcoins I sent him for dollars to avoid just that risk.) Still, the currency is young and has several attributes that appeal to merchants. Robert Schwarz, the owner of a computer-repair business in Klamath Falls, Oregon, began selling computers for bitcoin to sidestep steep credit-card fees, which he estimates cost him three per cent on every transaction. “One bank called me saying they had the lowest fees,” Schwarz said. “I said, ‘No, you don’t. Bitcoin does.’ ” Because bitcoin transfers can’t be reversed, merchants also don’t have to deal with credit-card charge-backs from dissatisfied customers. Like cash, it’s gone once you part with it.
At the Howard Johnson, Kim led us to the check-in counter. The lobby featured imitation-crystal chandeliers, ornately framed oil paintings of Venice, and, inexplicably, a pair of faux elephant tusks painted gold. Kim explained that he hadn’t told his mother, who owned the place, that her hotel was accepting bitcoins: “It would be too hard to explain what a bitcoin is.” He said he had activated the tracking program on his mother’s Droid, and she was currently about six miles away. Today, at least, there was no danger of her finding out about her hotel’s financial innovation. The receptionist handed me a room card, and Kim shook my hand. “So just enjoy your stay,” he said.
Nakamoto’s extensive online postings have some distinctive characteristics. First of all, there is the flawless English. Over the course of two years, he dashed off about eighty thousand words—the approximate length of a novel—and made only a few typos. He covered topics ranging from the theories of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises to the history of commodity markets. Perhaps most interestingly, when he created the first fifty bitcoins, now known as the “genesis block,” he permanently embedded a brief line of text into the data: “The Times Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”
This is a reference to a Times of London article that indicated that the British government had failed to stimulate the economy. Nakamoto appeared to be saying that it was time to try something new. The text, hidden amid a jumble of code, was a sort of digital battle cry. It also indicated that Nakamoto read a British newspaper. He used British spelling (“favour,” “colour,” “grey,” “modernised”) and at one point described something as being “bloody hard.” An apartment was a “flat,” math was “maths,” and his comments tended to appear after normal business hours ended in the United Kingdom. In an initial post announcing bitcoin, he employed American-style spelling. But after that a British style appeared to flow naturally.
I had this in mind when I started to attend the lectures at the Crypto 2011 conference, including ones with titles such as “Leftover Hash Lemma, Revisited” and “Time-Lock Puzzles in the Random Oracle Model.” In the back of a darkened auditorium, I stared at the attendee list. A Frenchman onstage was talking about testing the security of encryption systems. The most effective method, he said, is to attack the system and see if it fails. I ran my finger past dozens of names and addresses, circling residents of the United Kingdom and Ireland. There were nine.
I soon discovered that six were from the University of Bristol, and they were all together at one of the conference’s cocktail parties. They were happy to chat but entirely dismissive of bitcoin, and none had worked with peer-to-peer technology. “It’s not at all interesting to us,” one of them said. The two other cryptographers from Britain had no history with large software projects. Then I started looking into a man named Michael Clear.
Clear was a young graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College in Dublin. Many of the other research students at Trinity posted profile pictures and phone numbers, but Clear’s page just had an e-mail address. A Web search turned up three interesting details. In 2008, Clear was named the top computer-science undergraduate at Trinity. The next year, he was hired by Allied Irish Banks to improve its currency-trading software, and he co-authored an academic paper on peer-to-peer technology. The paper employed British spelling. Clear was well versed in economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networks.
I e-mailed him, and we agreed to meet the next morning on the steps outside the lecture hall. Shortly after the appointed time, a long-haired, square-jawed young man in a beige sweater walked up to me, looking like an early-Zeppelin Robert Plant. With a pronounced brogue, he introduced himself. “I like to keep a low profile,” he said. “I’m curious to know how you found me.”
I told him I had read about his work for Allied Irish, as well as his paper on peer-to-peer technology, and was interested because I was researching bitcoin. I said that his work gave him a unique insight into the subject. He was wearing rectangular Armani glasses and squinted so much I couldn’t see his eyes.
He responded calmly to my questions. He was twenty-three years old and studied theoretical cryptography by himself in Dublin—there weren’t any other cryptographers at Trinity. But he had been programming computers since he was ten and he could code in a variety of languages, including C++, the language of bitcoin. Given that he was working in the banking industry during tumultuous times, I asked how he felt about the ongoing economic crisis. “It could have been averted,” he said flatly.
Soon after I met Clear, I travelled to Glasgow, Kentucky, to see what bitcoin mining looked like. As I drove into the town of fourteen thousand, I passed shuttered factories and a central square lined with empty storefronts. On Howdy 106.5, a local radio station, a man tried to sell his bed, his television, and his basset hound—all for a hundred and ten dollars.
I had come to visit Kevin Groce, a forty-two-year-old bitcoin miner. His uncles had a garbage-hauling business and had let him set up his operation at their facility. The dirt parking lot was jammed with garbage trucks, which reeked in the summer sun.
“I like to call it the new moonshining,” Groce said, in a smooth Kentucky drawl, as he led me into a darkened room. One wall was lined with four-foot-tall homemade computers with blinking green and red lights. The processors inside were working so hard that their temperature had risen to a hundred and seventy degrees, and heat radiated into the room. Each system was a jumble of wires and hacked-together parts, with a fan from Walmart duct-taped to the top. Groce had built them three months earlier, for four thousand dollars. Ever since, they had generated a steady flow of bitcoins, which Groce exchanged for dollars, averaging about a thousand per month so far. He figured his investment was going to pay off.
Groce was wiry, with wisps of gray in his hair, and he split his time between working on his dad’s farm, repairing laptops at a local computer store, and mining bitcoin. Groce’s father didn’t understand Kevin’s enthusiasm for the new currency and expected him to take over the farm. “If it’s not attached to a cow, my dad doesn’t think much of it,” Groce said.
Groce was engaged to be married, and planned to use some of his bitcoin earnings to pay for a wedding in Las Vegas later in the year. He had tried to explain to his fiancée how they could afford it, but she doubted the financial prudence of filling a room with bitcoin-mining rigs. “She gets to cussing every time we talk about it,” Groce confided. Still, he was proud of the powerful computing center he had constructed. The machines ran non-stop, and he could control them remotely from his iPhone. The arrangement allowed him to cut tobacco with his father and monitor his bitcoin operation at the same time.
Nakamoto knew that competition for bitcoins would eventually lead people to build these kinds of powerful computing clusters. Rather than let that effort go to waste, he designed software that uses the processing power of the lottery players to confirm and verify transactions. As people like Groce try to win bitcoins, their computers are harnessed to analyze transactions and insure that no one spends money twice. In other words, Groce’s backwoods operation functioned as a kind of bank.
Groce, however, didn’t look like a guy Wells Fargo would hire. He liked to stay up late at the garbage-hauling center and thrash through Black Sabbath tunes on his guitar. He gave all his computers pet names, like Topper and the Dazzler, and, between guitar solos, tended to them as if they were prize animals. “I grew up milking cows,” Groce said. “Now I’m just milking these things.”
The next morning, Clear sent a lengthy e-mail. “It is apparent that the person(s) behind the Satoshi name accumulated a not insignificant knowledge of applied cryptography,” he wrote, adding that the design was “elegant” and required “considerable effort and dedication, and programming proficiency.” But Clear also described some of bitcoin’s weaknesses. He pointed out that users were expected to download their own encryption software to secure their virtual wallets. Clear felt that the bitcoin software should automatically provide such security. He also worried about the system’s ability to grow and the fact that early adopters received an outsized share of bitcoins.
“As far as the identity of the author, it would be unfair to publish an identity when the person or persons taken major steps to remain anonymous,” he wrote. “But you may wish to talk to a certain individual who matches the profile of the author on many levels.”
Lehdonvirta is a thirty-one-year-old Finnish researcher at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology. Clear had discovered that Lehdonvirta used to be a video-game programmer and now studies virtual currencies. Clear suggested that he was a solid fit for Nakamoto.
Lehdonvirta, however, pointed out that he has no background in cryptography and limited C++ programming skills. “You need to be a crypto expert to build something as sophisticated as bitcoin,” Lehdonvirta said. “There aren’t many of those people, and I’m definitely not one of them.”
Still, Lehdonvirta had researched bitcoin and worried about it. “The only people who need cash in large denominations right now are criminals,” he said, pointing out that cash is hard to move around and store. Bitcoin removes those obstacles while preserving the anonymity of cash. Lehdonvirta is on the advisory board of Electronic Frontier Finland, an organization that advocates for online privacy, among other things. Nonetheless, he believes that bitcoin takes privacy too far. “Only anarchists want absolute, unbreakable financial privacy,” he said. “We need to have a back door so that law enforcement can intercede.”
But Lehdonvirta admitted that it’s hard to stop new technology, particularly when it has a compelling story. And part of what attracts people to bitcoin, he said, is the mystery of Nakamoto’s true identity. “Having a mythical background is an excellent marketing trick,” Lehdonvirta said.
I told him that Lehdonvirta had made a convincing denial, and that every other lead I’d been working on had gone nowhere. I then took one more opportunity to question him and to explain all the reasons that I suspected his involvement. Clear responded that his work for Allied Irish Banks was brief and of “no importance.” He admitted that he was a good programmer, understood cryptography, and appreciated the bitcoin design. But, he said, economics had never been a particular interest of his. “I’m not Satoshi,” Clear said. “But even if I was I wouldn’t tell you.”
The point, Clear continued, is that Nakamoto’s identity shouldn’t matter. The system was built so that we don’t have to trust an individual, a company, or a government. Anybody can review the code, and the network isn’t controlled by any one entity. That’s what inspires confidence in the system. Bitcoin, in other words, survives because of what you can see and what you can’t. Users are hidden, but transactions are exposed. The code is visible to all, but its origins are mysterious. The currency is both real and elusive—just like its founder.
Over the summer, bitcoin actually experienced a sort of nuclear attack. Hackers targeted the burgeoning currency, and though they couldn’t break Nakamoto’s code, they were able to disrupt the exchanges and destroy Web sites that helped users store bitcoins. The number of transactions decreased and the exchange rate plummeted. Commentators predicted the end of bitcoin. In September, however, volume began to increase again, and the price stabilized, at least temporarily.
Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Kevin Groce added two new systems to his bitcoin-mining operation at the garbage depot and planned to build a dozen more. Ricky Wells, his uncle and a co-owner of the garbage business, had offered to invest thirty thousand dollars, even though he didn’t understand how bitcoin worked. “I’m just a risk-taking son of a bitch and I know this thing’s making money,” Wells said. “Plus, these things are so damn hot they’ll heat the whole building this winter.”
To Groce, bitcoin was an inevitable evolution in money. People use printed money less and less as it is, he said. Consumers need something like bitcoin to take its place. “It’s like eight-tracks going to cassettes to CDs and now MP3s,” he said.
Even though his friends and most of his relatives questioned his enthusiasm, Groce didn’t hide his confidence. He liked to wear a T-shirt he designed that had the words “Bitcoin Millionaire” emblazoned in gold on the chest. He admitted that people made fun of him for it. “My fiancée keeps saying she’d rather I was just a regular old millionaire,” he said. “But maybe I will be someday, if these rigs keep working for me.” ♦

Monero is not only committed to making a fungible currency, but also to continued research into the realm of financial privacy as it involves cryptocurrencies. Below you'll find the work of our very own Monero Research Lab, with more papers to come. To contact the Monero Research Lab, please email [email protected] ( )
*Abstract:* Confidential transactions are used in distributed digital assets to demonstrate the balance of values hidden in commitments, while retaining signer ambiguity. Previous work describes a signer-ambiguous proof of knowledge of the opening of commitments to zero at the same index across multiple public commitment sets and the evaluation of a verifiable random function used as a linking tag, and uses this to build a linkable ring signature called Triptych that can be used as a building block for a confidential transaction model. In this work, we extend Triptych to build Arcturus, a proving system that proves knowledge of openings of multiple commitments to zero within a single set, correct construction of a verifiable random function evaluated at each opening, and value balance across a separate list of commitments within a single proof. While soundness depends on a novel dual discrete-logarithm hardness assumption, we use data from the Monero blockchain to show that Arcturus can be used in a confidential transaction model to provide faster total batch verification time than other state-of-the-art constructions without a trusted setup.
*Abstract:* Ring signatures are a common construction used to provide signer ambiguity among a non-interactive set of public keys specified at the time of signing. Unlike early approaches where signature size is linear in the size of the signer anonymity set, current optimal solutions either require centralized trusted setups or produce signatures logarithmic in size. However, few also provide linkability, a property used to determine whether the signer of a message has signed any previous message, possibly with restrictions on the anonymity set choice. Here we introduce Triptych, a family of linkable ring signatures without trusted setup that is based on generalizations of zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of commitment openings to zero. We demonstrate applications of Triptych in signer-ambiguous transaction protocols by extending the construction to openings of parallel commitments in independent anonymity sets. Signatures are logarithmic in the anonymity set size and, while verification complexity is linear, collections of proofs can be efficiently verified in batches. We show that for anonymity set sizes practical for use in distributed protocols, Triptych offers competitive performance with a straightforward construction.
*Abstract:* We demonstrate that a version of non-slanderability is a natural definition of unforgeability for linkable ring signatures. We present a linkable ring signature construction with concise signatures and multi-dimensional keys that is linkably anonymous if a variation of the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem with random oracles is hard, linkable if key aggregation is a one-way function, and non-slanderable if a one-more variation of the discrete logarithm problem is hard. We remark on some applications in signer-ambiguous confidential transaction models without trusted setup.
*Abstract:* This technical note describes an algorithm used to prove knowledge of the same discrete logarithm across different groups. The scheme expresses the common value as a scalar representation of bits, and uses a set of ring signatures to prove each bit is a valid value that is the same (up to an equivalence) across both scalar groups.
*Abstract:* We present threshold ring multi-signatures (thring signatures) for collaborative computation of ring signatures, present a game of existential forgery for thring signatures, and discuss uses of thring signatures in digital currencies that include spender-ambiguous cross-chain atomic swaps for confidential amounts without a trusted setup. We present an implementation of thring signatures that we call linkable spontaneous threshold anonymous group signatures, and prove the implementation existentially unforgeable.
*Abstract:* This bulletin describes a modification to Monero's linkable ring signature scheme that permits dual-key outputs as ring members. Key images are tied to both output one-time public keys in a dual, preventing both keys in that transaction from being spent separately. This method has applications to non-interactive refund transactions. We discuss the security implications of the scheme.
*Abstract:* This technical note generalizes the concept of spend outputs using basic set theory. The definition captures a variety of earlier work on identifying such outputs. We quantify the effects of this analysis on the Monero blockchain and give a brief overview of mitigations.
*Abstract:* Users of the Monero cryptocurrency who wish to reuse wallet addresses in an unlinkable way must maintain separate wallets, which necessitates scanning incoming transactions for each one. We document a new address scheme that allows a user to maintain a single master wallet address and generate an arbitrary number of unlinkable subaddresses. Each transaction needs to be scanned only once to determine if it is destinated for any of the user’s subaddresses. The scheme additionally supports multiple outputs to other subaddresses, and is as efficient as traditional wallet transactions.
*Abstract:* This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work “mining” process. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. Some extensions of the protocol are provided, such as Aggregate Schnorr Range Proofs, and Ring Multisignature. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in [14] showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at 
*Abstract:* We identify several blockchain analysis attacks available to degrade the untraceability of the CryptoNote 2.0 protocol. We analyze possible solutions, discuss the relative merits and drawbacks to those solutions, and recommend improvements to the Monero protocol that will hopefully provide long-term resistance of the cryptocurrency against blockchain analysis. Our recommended improvements to Monero include a protocol-level network-wide minimum mix-in policy of n = 2 foreign outputs per ring signature, a protocol-level increase of this value to n = 4 after two years, and a wallet-level default value of n = 4 in the interim. We also recommend a torrent-style method of sending Monero output. We also discuss a non-uniform, age-dependent mix-in selection method to mitigate the other forms of blockchain analysis identified herein, but we make no formal recommendations on implementation for a variety of reasons. The ramifications following these improvements are also discussed in some detail. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
*Abstract:* Recently, there have been some vague fears about the CryptoNote source code and protocol floating around the internet based on the fact that it is a more complicated protocol than, for instance, Bitcoin. The purpose of this note is to try and clear up some misconceptions, and hopefully remove some of the mystery surrounding Monero Ring Signatures. I will start by comparing the mathematics involved in CryptoNote ring signatures (as described in [CN]) to the mathematics in [FS], on which CryptoNote is based. After this, I will compare the mathematics of the ring signature to what is actually in the CryptoNote codebase.
*Abstract:* On 4 September 2014, an unusual and novel attack was executed against the Monero cryptocurrency network. This attack partitioned the network into two distinct subsets which refused to accept the legitimacy of the other subset. This had myriad effects, not all of which are yet known. The attacker had a short window of time during which a sort of counterfeiting could occur, for example. This research bulletin describes deficiencies in the CryptoNote reference code allowing for this attack, describes the solution initially put forth by Rafal Freeman from Tigusoft.pl and subsequently by the CryptoNote team, describes the current fix in the Monero code base, and elaborates upon exactly what the offending block did to the network. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
*Abstract:* This research bulletin describes a plausible attack on a ring-signature based anonymity system. We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote 2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature. This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
*Summary:* Monero uses a unique hash function that transforms scalars into elliptic curve points. It is useful for creating key images, in particular. This document, authored by Shen Noether, translates its code implementation (the ge_fromfe_frombytes_vartime() function) into mathematical expressions.
The Monero Research Lab released an annotated version of the cryptonote whitepaper. This is sort of like an informal review of the claims that are made line-by-line of the whitepaper. It also explains some of the harder concepts in relatively easy to understand terms.----




http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/26/large-bitcoin-exchanges-attacks

Computer scientists Tyler Moore (from the Southern Methodist University, Dallas) and Nicolas Christin (of Carnegie Mellon University) found 40 exchanges on the web which offered a service of changing bitcoins into other fiat currencies or back again. Of those 40, 18 have gone out of business -- 13 closing without warning, and five closing after suffering security breaches that forced them to close. Four other exchanges have suffered serious attacks but remain open.
One of those is Mt Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, with Moore and Christin stating that at its peak it handles more than 40,000 Bitcoin transactions a day, compared to a mean average of 1,716. It has been the victim of a huge number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks over the past month during the peak of the Bitcoin bubble (and its subsequent bursting -- though the price now appears to be rising again). Its latest statement ( ) , dealing with the attack it suffered on 21 April, is long and comprehensive, seeking to assuage the fears of Bitcoin users who feel that Mt Gox is becoming a weak chain in Bitcoin's infrastructure.
The sheer quantity of trade done on Mt Gox has made it an extremely attractive target for hackers wishing to manipulate the wider Bitcoin price. That is the paradox that Moore and Christin discovered in their analysis -- that an exchange needs to maintain a transaction volume above a certain level to survive, but becoming large enough to survive also makes a hack of that exchange worthwhile for cyber attackers.
The study said: "Exchanges handling 275 Bitcoins' worth of transactions each day have a 20 percent chance of being breached, compared to a 70 percent chance for exchanges processing daily transactions worth 5570 Bitcoins." Moore and Christin estimate that the median lifespan of any Bitcoin exchange is 381 days, with a 29.9 percent chance that a new exchange will close within a year of opening.
An extra risk for customers is losing their money from exchanges closing. Of the 18 closed exchanges, there was evidence that only six reimbursed their customers. Five did not, while there was not evidence enough to make a judgement regarding the remaining seven.
However, they found that there was still a significant degree of randomness behind the success or failures of many exchanges, which could be down to whether an exchange has a good or bad reputation (something they didn't control for). For instance, they point to Vircurex ( ) as an exchange that has had low transaction volumes since opening in 2011, and which suffered a large attack in 2013, but which has remained open regardless. Bitfloor, which lost money in one of the first high-profile Bitcoin break-ins, was not so lucky.
Also, a sample size of only 40 exchanges does means that some of their other results didn't reach statistical significance -- it's going to take more time, as Bitcoin matures as a currency, for exchanges to appear and be eligible as samples for a more thorough analysis.
The paper, "Beware the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin-Exchange Risk", has been published online ( ) , and was presented at the 17th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference ( ).

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain

Blocks in the main chain (black) are the longest series of blocks that go from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Purple blocks are blocks that are not in the longest chain and therefore not used.
A *block chain* is a transaction database shared by all nodes ( ) participating in a system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ( ) ever executed in the currency. With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address ( ) at any point in history.
Every block ( ) contains a hash ( ) of the previous block. This has the effect of creating a chain of blocks from the genesis block ( ) to the current block. Each block is guaranteed to come after the previous block chronologically because the previous block's hash would otherwise not be known. Each block is also computationally impractical to modify once it has been in the chain for a while because every block after it would also have to be regenerated. These properties are what make bitcoins transactions irreversible ( ). The block chain is the main innovation of Bitcoin.
Honest generators only build onto a block (by referencing it in blocks they create) if it is the latest block in the longest valid chain. "Length" is calculated as total combined difficulty of that chain, not number of blocks, though this distinction is only important in the context of a few potential attacks. A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid, and only if it starts with the genesis block.
For any block on the chain, there is only one path to the genesis block. Coming from the genesis block, however, there can be forks. One-block forks are created from time to time when two blocks are created just a few seconds apart. When that happens, generating nodes build onto whichever one of the blocks they received first. Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer. More serious forks have occurred after fixing bugs that required backward-incompatible changes.
Blocks in shorter chains (or invalid chains) are not used for anything. When the bitcoin client switches to another, longer chain, all valid transactions of the blocks inside the shorter chain are re-added to the pool of queued transactions and will be included in another block. The reward for the blocks on the shorter chain will not be present in the longest chain, so they will be practically lost, which is why a network-enforced 100-block maturation time for generations exists.
These blocks on the shorter chains are often called "orphan" blocks. This is because the generation transactions do not have a parent block in the longest chain, so these generation transactions show up as orphan in the listtransactions RPC call. Several pools have misinterpreted these messages and started calling their blocks "orphans". In reality, these blocks have a parent block, and might even have children.
Satoshi ( ) actually used the term time chain [1] ( #cite_note-1 ). Only at a later point the word blockchain became in widespread use, but mostly by promoters of altcoins ( ) and consulting agencies marketing their services to big corporations and governments.
Blockchain is touted as a magical fairy dust solution that you can sprinkle over a problem and end up with an amazing solution. ICOs have perfected this art (often combining it with other buzz words like IoT and AI) and raised billions of dollars to deliver virtually nothing. If someone comes to you talking about a blockchain project: run if you don't know them. If they're a friend or family, explain to them that it's nonsense to use a blockchain without strong proof of work ( ) and an adequately decentralized network of nodes.----

In the coming years, the technology behind crypto currencies such as Bitcoin will inevitably and radically change the role of traditional trusted parties such as banks, accountants, notaries, and governments. The possibilities are endless. We invite you to explore this new technology constructively and critically, and have an open discussion about the potential applications.
This brings us to the essence of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s software enables a network of computers to maintain a collective bookkeeping via the internet. This bookkeeping is neither closed nor in control of one party.
In the Blockchain, all transactions are logged including information on the date, time, participants and amount of every single transaction. Each node in the network owns a full copy of the Blockchain.
On the basis of complicated state-of-the-art mathematical principles, the transactions are verified by the so-called Bitcoin Miners, who maintain the ledger. The mathematical principles also ensure that these nodes automatically and continuously agree about the current state of the ledger and every transaction in it.
The ledger doesn’t care whether a bitcoin represents a certain amount of euros or dollars, or anything else of value or property for that matter. Users can decide for themselves what a unit of bitcoin represents.
A bitcoin is divisable in 100 million units! And each unit is both individually identifiable and programmable. This means that users can assign properties to each unit. Users can program a unit to represent a eurocent, or a share in a company, a kilowatt-hour of energy or a digital certificate of ownership.
Imagine a healthcare allowance in dollars or euros that can only be used to pay for healthcare at certified parties. In this case, whether someone actually follows the rules is no longer verified in the bureaucratic process afterwards.
The programmable, open character of Bitcoin allows us to completely rebuild and innovate our financial sector and our administrative processes, make them more efficient and more transparent, and significantly decrease bureaucracy.
In an “internet of things”, our economy will be dealing with machines that actively participate in the economic traffic. In fact, they are already here. Think of a vending machine. Or drones delivering packages.
Bitcoin and crypto currencies have caused a paradigm shift. So, It’s about time to explore this new technology constructively and critically, and have an open discussion about the potential applications.

https://cryptoinsider.media/timechain-satoshis-original-vision-blockchain-bitcoin/

In the year 2019, the term blockchain is so ubiquitous that the Oxford dictionary has felt compelled to include its definition ( ) , and text processors no longer highlight it as a typo. However, as presented in the 2008 pre-release source code of Bitcoin (which circulated on the cypherpunk ( ) mailing list), the first name of blockchain was actually “timechain”.
Prominent Canadian bitcoiner Francis Pouliot has recently highlighted a series of lesser-known facts in a Twitter thread, and it’s strange to see how little the general public knows about the early phases of Bitcoin. For mostly ideological reasons, there is a crowd of people who choose to believe that Satoshi’s cryptocurrency was a quickly-coded project which arrived as a response to the 2008 financial crisis.
While it might be true that the release could have been rushed to synchronize with the “Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” headline, these bits of information reveal a thorough review process that usually isn’t allowed to obstruct the way of a romanticized story.
The idea of the blockchain being called a timechain back in late 2008 is a clear reminder that Satoshi wasn’t exactly certain about his decisions, the technology was still in its infancy, and there really isn’t something prophetic about the work of the mysterious cypherpunk (or group of cypherpunks). It’s innovative, but it arrived at this stage and to the conclusions of the whitepaper ( ) through constant trial and error that we seldom talk about.
Furthermore, the Bitcoin terminologies in this pre-release source code ( ) reveal another peculiarity: the BTC unit was referred to as “coin”, while the satoshis were called “cents”. In the age where Lightning allows users to send amounts smaller than one Satoshi (the hundred millionth part of a bitcoin), this comes as an interesting historic fact which reveals the original intentions of the creator.
Timechains and cents aside, there is more information to be discovered in this early prototype of Bitcoin. For instance, a section described in the source code as Add atoms to user reviews for coins created” indicates that some kind of rating system was intended to be included. According to cryptographer and early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, Satoshi wanted to add an “ integrated P2P eBay-style market ( ) ” which establishes a reputation system that’s based on the amount of individual mining performed. Interestingly, this addition was completely dropped and never mentioned again – yet another proof that the creator was undecided and willing to experiment.
This also reminds us that the anonymous creator of the protocol didn’t predict mining pools and considered Bitcoin as something to which everyone should participate via mining with their own computers. Also, the inclusion of “atoms” is something that we will probably never understand – and not even the prolific cryptographer and developer Peter Todd was able to make sense out of it ( ).
This “timechain” version of Bitcoin also includes a different hash for the genesis block, which indicates that more experimentation has been done in the field prior to the acclaimed public release ( ).
0x000006b15d1327d67e971d1de9116bd60a3a01556c91b6ebaa416ebc0cfaa646 (the experimental hash of the first pre-release Bitcoin block) looks like a peculiarity to those accustomed with 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (the hash of the Genesis Block ( ) ).
While this information has been available to the public since at least December 23th 2013, there just wasn’t much media coverage about it. A simple search engine inquiry which uses the terms “timechain bitcoin” will only display a few results and highlight to a different project ( ) that seems to have appropriated the name.
The fascinating part is that the data has been publicly available for more than five years, yet the comments of BitcoinTalk users Cryddit, Peter Todd, deepceleron, and Mike Hearn are still obscure. Therefore, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to shine a light on these little-known facts.
Riccardo “Fluffy Pony” Spagni has presented more details about the code that Satoshi removed from Bitcoin, with a focus on the unfinished distributed marketplace for which the rating system was required.
Since his public emergence in the space, nChain scientist Craig S. Wright has constantly pretended to be Satoshis Nakamoto, or at least the head of the team which developed Bitcoin. His narrative has constantly shifted from a laid-back approach of wishing to stay away from public scrutiny (as expressed in the revealing BBC interview ( ) ) to an aggressive campaign to appropriate the Bitcoin brand for his altcoin.
Recently, Mr. Wright has begun to write blog posts ( ) which feature compelling stories from 2009 and 2010, when he supposedly released Bitcoin to the public and saw the early developments surrounding it. However, none of the essential details presented in the previous section of the article are highlighted in the narrative pieces which more or less purposely stay away from technical discussions.
The stories of Craig S. Wright are emotional, relate to personal events, but don’t make use of the technical jargon that Satoshi Nakamoto has introduced to the world. By looking up “Craig S. Wright timechain” on Google, only one journalistic piece ( ) on the Wired website presents details about the original name of the blockchain, when the Australian scientist is quoted. Other than that, there are only a few forum discussions to which Mr. Wright didn’t participate.
This only goes to show the history isn’t quite on the side of Craig S. Wright, and the narrative he presents as a justification for bearing “Satoshi’s Vision” is both fictional and incomplete. And if you’re ever in doubt about Mr. Wright’s true colors, just take a look at this 2015 panel discussion where he debates Nick Szabo (a worthier candidate for the Satoshi title) and Trace Mayer: the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin shies away from backing up the statements that he now iterates every waking hour, and even makes questionable statements about the protocol being Turing complete.
The missing or modified elements from Bitcoin are also bad news for purists who read the whitepaper as gospel that should not be questioned. In this regard, these early struggles of Satoshi prove to us that intentions and main ideas are much more important than a solution that can be dated back to December 2008. While Satoshi was still around, he allowed early adopters like Hal Finney to make improvements to the open-sourced protocol and effectively turn Bitcoin into the project we have today.
In terms of the law, there are two ways of interpreting texts: by taking into account the literal context of the law, or by considering its spirit (intentions). When it comes to Bitcoin and Satoshi, it’s healthier to assess that the protocol should serve fundamental functions to preserve core ideas, rather than change according to the expectations of speculative investors or destructive actors.
There will always be purists to point out to the division between their interpretation and the status-quo, and this can lead to philosophic and religious discussions about what Bitcoin should be. Nevertheless, it’s healthier to regard Bitcoin as a modern language: it takes elements and word roots from thousands of years of developments, but it evolves through time thanks to the various waves of adopters who enrich the jargon.
Ultimately, as long as we have a truly decentralized protocol which ensures the easy participation of anyone to the block validation and discovery process, has ties to the known Genesis block and allows Satoshi to return any time to reclaim his coins, it’s still Bitcoin. Also, Craig S. Wright is not Satoshi.
*Later edit:* Thanks to a contribution by Riccardo “Fluffy Pony” Spagni, more details about the distributed marketplace embedded in the original Bitcoin client. All the code that Satoshi removed in later versions can be found in this GitHub repository ( ).
The above is to be considered opinion and not investment advice in any way, as an unbiased media, no one interferes with the Editorial content of CryptoInsider.com, writers have freedom to choose their own direction, members of Crypto Insider do not participate in trades based on content.
Vlad is a political science graduate who got a little tired and disillusioned with the old highly-hierarchical and centralized world and decided to give this anarchistic blockchain invention a little try. He found out about Bitcoin in 2014, had to do a presentation about it at Sciences Po Paris in 2015, but was too foolish to buy any. Now that he’ll never be a crypto millionaire and hasn’t acquired his golden ticket to lifelong financial independence, he’ll just write op-eds on various topics.----

http://cointelegraph.com/news/113425/not-publicly-discussed-european-companies-seeking-privacy-from-us

Steve Banker wrote ( ) about the security ( ) issue early last year for the blog, following an article in IT World that noted companies increasingly want their data “ walled off ( ) ” from the NSA:
Banker is a supply chain and logistics analyst who writes for the ARC Advisory Group ( ). The group “works closely with leading manufacturers, retailers, logistics service providers, and technology companies” to “assist them with strategic decisions, [and] guide them with industry best practices and latest technology solutions.”
Privacy also matters to people who run companies; in this case, European ones. He says they “could see value” in their financial transactions ( ) not only being cheaper, but also “being kept far more private and secure than is possible under current processes.”
In a January 23 Wall Street Journal article ( ) , Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna—the authors of the new book “ The Age of ( ) Cryptocurrency ( ) ”—explain these current processes. In Banker’s industry jargon, they demonstrate the “order-to-cash supply chain.”
The traditional credit card process increasingly happens “in the cloud.” Banker forecasts that such applications “will account for 50 to 60 percent of the total enterprise application market within 5 to 6 years because of advantages related to speed of development of new functionality, easier implementations and much, much easier upgrades.”
Cloud services may save time, but they can increase the risk of stolen data. Bitcoin, however, could save time while securing data. Startup companies in the crypto space are working to build upon these benefits.
Mike Lorrey ( ) , president and chairman of Galactic Systems, Inc., says many companies “go beyond payments ( ) privacy to embedding contracts, including copyright or DRM [digital rights management], into blockchain ( ) technology.”
Rik Willard, in charge of branding and marketing at MintCombine ( ) , says his company “has been studying blockchain DRM with a former CEO of Virgin Records for the past year. ... It makes perfect sense that companies everywhere will begin to look into this more as time goes on. ... It’s going to be global.”
Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are global, but after the Snowden revelations, Banker says that—“while not publicly discussed”—large European companies are expressing a desire to protect themselves against data sniffing by the U.S. Specifically:
The biggest block to such companies seeking safety in Bitcoin, of course, is the fluctuation in the cryptocurrency’s price. If the swings lessen, Banker predicts, companies may begin to see the value of Bitcoin technology to their privacy.----




https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/alphabay-comments-on-bitcoin-congestion-monero-adoption-and-zcash-possibilities-1482345512/

While Silk Road ( ) popularized the industry back in 2011, AlphaBay ( ) is the now the most widely used darknet market ( ) in existence. Usage statistics are hard to come by when it comes to Tor hidden services ( ) , but in an interview with Deep Dot Web earlier this year ( ) , the site’s head administrator claimed many vendors from the now-defunct Evolution ( ) marketplace have moved over to AlphaBay.
Many Bitcoin-related companies have had to deal with an increase in support tickets due to the increased congestion ( ) on the network this past year, and AlphaBay has not been spared this headache. “It has become an issue when there is [a] backlog on the blockchain, as many newbie users complain about missing deposits while they are in fact unconfirmed ( ) ,” a member of the AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.
Although various improvements to privacy and scalability were discussed at a Scaling Bitcoin ( ) workshop in Milan this past October, AlphaBay does not currently have any plans to run a Tumblebit ( ) hub or a Lightning Network ( ) node. “We have our own proprietary tumbling platform,” said the support representative.
It should be noted that the code for these projects are still works in progress. While the upcoming social media app Yours ( ) has implemented their own micropayments solution ( ) , a more elegant version of the Lightning Network will be possible if or when Segregated Witness ( ) is activated on the network. Tumblebit does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, although it would be improved ( ) by Segregated Witness ( ). At least two implementations are currently in development ( ).
After AlphaBay and Oasis (another darknet market) integrated Monero payments in late August ( ) , the market cap of Monero ( ) grew from around $25 million to over $170 million in a couple of weeks. The market cap has now settled around $110 million.
While Oasis appears to have pulled an exit scam ( ) (they ran away with users’ money) since their Monero announcement, AlphaBay is still alive and kicking. An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine that Monero accounts for 2 percent of AlphaBay’s business.
According to MoneroStats ( ) , there were less than 500 transactions per day on the Monero network before the darknet markets took an interest in the Bitcoin alternative. Now, there is usually three times that amount. It’s unclear how much of that transaction growth is due to real usage and how much is an increased number of speculators moving their coins between exchanges.
Zcash has launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero, and many are wondering if this could be the next altcoin tested out by the darknet markets. The Zcash market cap ( ) is currently less than a tenth of Monero’s.----

The live *Monero price today* is $136.31 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $145,487,955 USD. We update our XMR to USD price in real-time. Monero is down 11.52% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #43, with a live market cap of $2,464,991,350 USD. It has a circulating supply of 18,083,651 XMR coins and the max. supply is not available.
If you would like to know where to buy Monero , the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in Monero stock are currently Binance ( ) , OKX ( ) , DigiFinex ( ) , Bybit ( ) , and Mandala Exchange ( ). You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page ( ).
Monero was launched in 2014, and its goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.
The team behind Monero say privacy and security are their biggest priorities, with ease of use and efficiency coming second. It aims to provide protection to all users — irrespective of how technologically competent they are.
Seven developers were initially involved in creating Monero — five of whom decided to remain anonymous. There have been rumors that XMR was also invented by Satoshi Nakamoto ( ) , the inventor of Bitcoin.
XMR’s origins can be traced back to Bytecoin, a privacy-focused and decentralized cryptocurrency that was launched in 2012. Two years later, a member of the Bitcointalk forum — only known as thankful for today — forked BCN’s codebase, and Monero was born. They had suggested “controversial changes” to Bytecoin that others in the community disagreed with and decided to take matters into their own hands.
There are several things that make Monero unique. One of the project’s biggest aims is achieving the greatest level of decentralization possible, meaning that a user doesn’t need to trust anyone else on the network.
Privacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured — and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are “selectively transparent.”
All of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin — especially on darknet markets. Governments around the world, especially the U.S., have also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who can crack Monero’s code.
This cryptocurrency is designed to be resistant to application-specific integrated circuits, which are commonly used for mining new Bitcoin. In theory, this means that it can be possible to mine XMR using everyday computing equipment.
Overall, there will eventually be a total of 18.4 million XMR in circulation — and this cap is expected to be reached on May 31, 2022. After this, miners will be incentivized using “tail emissions,” with a small amount of XMR being fed into the system every 60 seconds as a reward. It is believed this approach is more effective than relying on transaction fees.
One of Monero’s main goals has to prevent centralization — and this network uses a consensus mechanism called CryptoNight, which is based on ( ) proof-of-work. This prevents large mining farms from becoming a dominant force.
Because of its nature as a privacy coin, XMR isn’t listed on some major exchanges. For example, although you can buy XMR on Binance ( ) , it isn’t supported by Coinbase. As a result, you may need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin and go through a smaller trading platform. This guide helps explain ( ) how you can convert fiat currencies into crypto with ease. As it’s use grows there has been increased interest in the XMR to AUD ( ) and XMR to EUR ( ) price pairs.----




https://coinjournal.net/tumblebit-part-1-bitcoin-privacy-proposal-compare-monero-zcash/

TumbleBit ( ) is one of the latest developments in the land of Bitcoin privacy proposals, and it’s gaining a large amount of attention from those who understand the importance of fungibility ( ) in digital cash systems. This privacy enhancement essentially allows a user to send transactions through a tumbler without the possibility of having their funds stolen or the tumbler learning about the connection between the sender and the receiver.
This improvement can be implemented without any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, which has some wondering how well Bitcoin will soon be able to compete against the more privacy-focused altcoins such as Monero ( ) and Zcash ( ).
Monero is a cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote protocol ( ). Ring signatures ( ) and stealth addresses ( ) are used to protect the privacy and anonymity of Monero users. The alternative cryptocurrency recently gained a bit of attention after it was integrated into a couple of darknet marketplaces ( ).
*“Monero is a separate blockchain from bitcoin, and it achieves its privacy by making spends ambiguous as to what coins are actually being spent,” explained Poelstra. “This requires that people be running Monero and using Monero coins to use this and that everyone using the system has to validate the blockchain, which grows much faster than say Bitcoin because of its scaling features.”*
When ask for his thoughts on TumbleBit, Spagni told CoinJournal , “Principally it seems fine, but practically it’s no better than a tumbler — if the tumbler was magically not going to steal your funds or leak metadata.”
*“Privacy is useless unless it’s enforced in the protocol,” Spagni added. “ Dash ( ) is an excellent example. There is so little usage of the privacy stuff that they’ve had to use their MasterNode budget to pay ‘liquidity providers’ to provide mixing liquidity. And if there happens to be tons of mixing liquidity, great, but how much of the mixing liquidity is untainted and not Sybil attacked ( ) ?”*
Poelstra explained that the need for a central server prevents TumbleBit from being implemented at the protocol level. “[Servers] are a single point of failure. They can be ephemeral and no funds are at risk, so it’s not a problem, but it makes it hard to integrate with a blockchain, which is forever.”
Implementing anonymization and privacy features in a cryptocurrency at the base protocol level, like Monero does, is generally better because it means everyone a user mixes their transactions with is mixing all of their other transactions as well.
Zcash is the culmination of many years of work on the creation of a truly anonymous digital cash system. Based on the work in the Zerocoin ( ) and Zerocash ( ) white papers, Zcash is described as following in the company’s FAQ ( ) :
*“Zcash is an open source, decentralized cryptocurrency, with system-wide privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensures the maximum possible privacy for transactions conducted within the network.”*
When buying Zcash ( ) , it is said to provide the highest level of anonymity possible when compared to other systems, but there are also some drawbacks ( ). “The privacy from Zcash would be a bit stronger because your anonymity set is all coins in the system vs TumbleBit, where it’s all coins in this round [of mixing],” said Poelstra. “But Zcash is much, much slower, it requires new crypto assumptions, and it’s still got that trusted setup. Though, my understanding is the Zcash folks have a tractable way to do the trusted setup in a multiparty way.”
When asked for his opinion on the matter, Zcash Advisor Andrew Miller ( ) agreed with the tradeoffs mentioned by Poelstra. “Zcash still has the advantage of a larger anonymity set after only one transaction,” said Miller. “You might also compare Bolt ( ) with TumbleBit in ‘lightning network’ mode. It’s cool that TumbleBit supports that. Bolt is like a lightning network channel for Zcash, the privacy is better here too, but I think it requires a modification to Zcash relative to the 1.0 plans.”
*“This gets to an essential question in blockchain design: What is the correct balance between building the features we want into the blockchain itself but increasing the complexity of consensus critical code or keeping the consensus critical code simple by building those features into the payment channel network layer instead?”*
Privacy is an essential aspect of any currency to maintain fungibility, and there will undoubtedly be many more privacy improvement proposals that alter what’s possible with digital cash systems in the future — including Monero and Zcash sidechains ( ) , which would essentially allow users to access to the features of those blockchains without the need to create a new altcoin (bitcoin would be used).
Miller was able to sum up the general feeling of those who are working on improving privacy in cryptocurrencies when he said, “Overall, I’m mostly just excited that there’s so much activity in this space now. I like Monero and CoinShuffle a lot too.”

https://gendal.me/2014/10/26/a-simple-explanation-of-bitcoin-sidechains/

It describes a way to build “pegged sidechains”. Sidechains themselves are not new – the idea, and how to build them, has been discussed for some time and the key breakthrough was outlined earlier in the year ( ). But this paper gives more detail on the concept and has attracted a lot of comment.
The key to understanding most innovations in the Bitcoin space is to make sure you have the right mental model for how Bitcoin itself works. It turns out that most people I speak to don’t really understand how it works and, as a result, have a faulty mental model.
First, clear your head of anything related to money, currency or payments. And clear your head of the word ledger , too. The mind-bending secret of Bitcoin is that there actually isn’t a ledger! The only data structures that matter are transactions and blocks of transactions. And it’s important to get this clear in your head if sidechains are going to make sense.
* In order to spend them, you have to prove you’re entitled to do so. And you do that by providing the solution to a challenge that was laid down when they were sent to you in the first place. This challenge is usually just: “prove to the world that you know the public key that corresponds to a particular Bitcoin address and are in possession of the corresponding private key”. But it can be more sophisticated than that.
* When you send Bitcoins somewhere, you lay down the challenge for the next owner. Usually, you’ll simply specify that they need to know the public and private keypair that correspond to the Bitcoin address the coins were sent to. But it can be more complicated than that. In the general case, you don’t even know who the next owner is… it’s just whoever can satisfy the condition.
Fine. So the “grammar” of a Bitcoin transaction is clear:   “Here are the coins I want to move, here’s the proof I’m entitled to and here’s what the recipient must do, in turn, if they want to spend them”.
This transaction is published into the network, it will eventually find its way into a block and, after other blocks have been built on top, everybody can be pretty sure it won’t be reversed and the world moves on.   What more do you need?
This three-part structure to a Bitcoin transaction works well and it turns out that you can do some really interesting things with it.   For example, you can use the “not-entirely fungible” feature to “tag” coins. This is the basis of the “ Colored Coins ( ) ” and “ Smart Property ( ) ” worlds.
Bitcoin’s block interval is ten minutes so it takes about five ten minutes on average for a new transaction to find its way into a block, even if it pays a high fee. This is too slow for some people so they have experimented with alternative cryptocurrencies, based on the Bitcoin code-base, which employ quicker block intervals   [UPDATED 2014-10-27 to correct my embarrassing misunderstanding of mathematics…]
The “three-part” transaction structure is very general but it only allows you to transfer ownership of Bitcoins. Some people would like to transmit richer forms of information across these sorts of systems. For example, a decentralized exchange needs a way for participants to place orders. Projects such as Mastercoin, Counterparty, NXT and others either build layers on top of Bitcoin or use entirely different codebases to achieve their goals.
I said above that you can build sophisticated rules into Bitcoin transactions to specify how ownership is proved. However, the Bitcoin scripting language is deliberately limited and many ideas in the Smart Contracts ( ) space are difficult or impossible to implement. So projects such as Ethereum ( ) are building an entirely new infrastructure to explore these ideas
It doesn’t matter if you’re moving $1bn or 0.01c across the Bitcoin network, you get the same security guarantees.   And you pay for this in fees and time.   What if you were prepared to trade safety for speed?   Today, your only real option is to send the coins to a centralized wallet provider, whom you must trust not to lose or steal your coins. You can then do all the transactions you like on their books, with their other customers and you never need touch the Bitcoin blockchain. But now you lose all the benefits of a decentralized value-transfer network.
Now, making experimental or rapid changes to Bitcoin is very risky and so change happens slowly. So if the one-size-fits-all architecture of Bitcoin doesn’t suit a particular use-case, you have a problem. You either have to use an entirely different cryptocurrency (or build one!). Or you have to use (or build) a centralized service, which brings new risks.
From the perspective of the Bitcoin network, Circle is a black box.   You had some coins… you sent them to a specific address…   some stuff happened that Bitcoin couldn’t see…. And at some point later, you had control of some coins again.   It’s as if those coins had been moved from Bitcoin to somewhere else and then back again.
Imagine there is a Bitcoin-like system out there that you’d like to use. Perhaps it’s litecoin or ethereum or perhaps it’s something brand new.   Maybe it has a faster block confirmation interval and a richer scripting language. It doesn’t matter.   The point is: you’d like to use it but would rather not have to go through the risk and effort of buying the native tokens for that platform. You have Bitcoins already. Why can’t you use them?
* Send your Bitcoins to a specially formed Bitcoin address. The address is specially designed so that the coins will now be out of your control… and out of the control of anybody else either. They’re completely immobilized and can only be unlocked if somebody can prove they’re no longer being used elsewhere (I’ll explain what I mean by this in a minute).   In other words, you’ve used the core bitcoin transaction rules I described above to lay down a specific condition that the future owner – whoever it ends up being – needs to fulfil in order to take control
* So it’s as if your Bitcoins have been transferred to this second chain. And remember: they’re immobilized on the Bitcoin network… so we haven’t created or destroyed any…. Just “moved” them.
* Perhaps blocks are created faster on that sidechain. Perhaps transaction scripts are “turing complete”. Perhaps you have to pay fees to incent those securing that sidechain. Who knows. The rules can be whatever those running that sidechain want them to be. The only rule that matters is that the sidechain agrees to follow the convention that if you can prove you put some Bitcoins out of reach on the Bitcoin network, the same number will pop into existence on the sidechain.
* And now for the second clever part. The logic above is symmetric. So, at any point, whoever is holding these coins on the sidechain can send them back to the Bitcoin network by creating a special transaction on the sidechain that immobilises the bitcoins on the sidechain. They’ll disappear from the sidechain and become available again on the Bitcoin network, under the control of whoever last owned them on the sidechain.
So, to repeat, we’ve used standard Bitcoin transaction functionality to move coins out of reach and we then prove to a second, unrelated chain, that we’ve done this.  And when we’re done, whoever owns them on the sidechain can do the same thing and send them back to the bitcoin network.
Step back from the details for moment and consider what’s been described.  We now have a way to move coins from Bitcoin onto another platform (a sidechain) and move them back again.   That’s pretty much what we do when we move them to a wallet platform or an exchange.  The difference is that the “platform” they’ve been moved to is also a blockchain… so it has the possibility of decentralised security, visibility and to gain from other innovation in this space.
And there are lots of other possibilities. The key is that you can build these experiments and products and services without also needing to create a new currency or fall back into the old centralised style.
I listedned to Adam Back speaking on this concept on the LTB show episode 99. I thought it was a genius idea at the time and it will allow experimenting. The bitcoin community will offer the right amount of critic to see that any potential faults are sealed.
It’s like Ripple in that Ripple allows IOUs to be issued from individual servers. So when you receive 10BTC IOU you can say “look, I have 10BTC as recorded over there at the server”. It’s basically the same thing in that way.
Frankly, secure implementation of Bitcoin is already a pain in the ass .. adding more complexity just seems like the wrong move at this point. It’s already trying to be a currency, a networking protocol and a client in the same codebase. Adding turing complete (or not) scripts with arbitrary outcomes, multiple versions of the official client cooperating, multiple clients, and now multiple blockchains is basically the nail in the coffin in terms of widespread implementation.
What Bitcoin’s development team is essentially doing through feature-creep is forcing everyone in the non-tech world to use Bitcoin through commercial proxies to avoid all this complexity (crypto-what? security? sidechain?), which effectively results in the loss of security, relative anonymity and decentralized properties that helped to make it interesting in the first place.
I have a hard time swallowing that Bitcoin “isn’t a ledger”. That’s like saying “Bitcoin isn’t the blockchain”, and if you take the blockchain away from Bitcoin, you aren’t really left with much (including, sidechains). Perhaps Bitcoin isn’t a ledger *from the perspective* of individual transactions, but by the same logic, nothing that isn’t transaction data is.
Splendid article. However, I am wondering about one thing. You write “Bitcoin’s block interval is ten minutes so it takes about five minutes on average for a new transaction to find its way into a block, even if it pays a high fee”.
Since “solving a block” on the blockchain is a completely random process, I’d expect the distribution of time-to-next-block to follow a Poisson distribution which means that it will take ten minutes on average for a new block to occur, not five.
I don’t think this is true. The expected time before the next block is always 10 minutes. The amount of time elapsed since the previous block has no bearing on the expected time from *now* (finding a block is designed to be a Poisson process).
@quinn – thanks for the comment. I probably didn’t write clearly enough… I was trying to point out that none of the higher-level concepts we’re familiar with (addresses, bitcoins, the “ledger”, etc) actually exist at the protocol level…. it’s just transactions, transaction outputs, unspent transaction outputs, etc… they combine to create the illusion we’re all familiar with.
@welly – good question… I should have addressed that in the article…. it would be interesting to think through whether you could implement a ripple gateway as a sidechain… (or ripple itself)? e.g. could this be a way to issue BTC IOUs onto the ripple system without counterparty risk with respect to whichever gateway issues the BTC liability?
@Richard- Sidechains appear to be an awkward implementation of Ripple gateways. My view is that counterparties (e.g. banks) are necessary. Counterparty risk remains in both versions, and Ripple is designed to automatically mitigate the degree of risk.
That said – I think some camps would strongly disagree – counterparty risk seems like a reasonable price to pay for systemic scalability and stability, especially when the risk can be mitigated with rules and governance that institutions like SWIFT and the Bank of England provide today.
This approach isn’t fool-proof, but it’s not by mistake that the system looks the way it does today (that’s my history degree talking). Despite best technical efforts, human problems remain within the realm of probability. From : “…blame cannot be easily assigned: not even the most sophisticated economists of the era could accurately predict disaster, let alone guard against it. The effects of a public herd mentality at the time of the [insert catastrophe here] are depicted, all too recognizably, as unstoppable.”
Sticking only to the historical, tried-and-true surface-crawling after the invention of heavier-than-air man-made flying in the early 1900s would be missing the fundamentally new possibility uncovered: a dramatic redefinition of long-distance in terms of time, cost & safety.
I need to read more about Ripple. Despite several approaches to it, I’ve never felt I get it. I was very intrigued by your describing sidechains as “an awkward implementation of Ripple gateways.”
It may sound nitpicky, but I think that description leaves something to be desired in terms of presenting the “correct” mental model. First, there is no such thing as “a” bitcoin, as I am sure the author would agree. Speaking of spending or moving bitcoins perpetuates the notion of bitcoins as “things”. It might be preferable to say that you are spending or moving “units of the bitcoin protocol”. There is something similar going on here with dollars. The dollars in your bank account aren’t things either, they are units of demand or claim on a currency. The fact that printed dollars have serial numbers tends to confuse this notion. Treating something as a “thing’ which is not a thing is sometimes referred to as the reification fallacy.
2. I have not had a chance to read the original article on side chains, but I am sure they deal with my next problem quite adequately. However it is not addressed in the above article. The primary problem that must be addressed with the notion of side chains, as I see it, would be the issue of the mining required to authenticate transactions and enter them into the block chain. The article mentions that side chain system more or less leaves the issue of verification within the side chain transactions as something of a black box, somewhat implying that they don’t have to be considered. But for any user, they would need to be both considered and understood. Such a process would presumably require mining verification of some kind, (our mental model must include consideration of the somewhat unusual verification method for bitcoin transactions themselves, – as everyone would agree, the verification process is not just a “checklist” of valid transaction strings. The validation process requires mining in much the same sense as mining new coin. None of this is mentioned or discussed in the article. ) As a result, the verification of side chain transactions outside the block chain introduces whole new layers of risk into the Bitcoin model, and new layers of unknowns.
My chief concern is not with the concept of side chains per se (yet). I have still much to learn about how they are being considered. I am only concerned with the way the concept is being presented here. However, I am sure that much of this was due to space restrictions as much as anything. The concept of side chains is an intriguing one. It is also clearly attempting to address a major problem with the whole Bitcoin scheme- namely the verification latency it introduces for transactions. This is only one of the hurdles facing Bitcoins acceptance into the world of commerce, but it is a considerable one.
1) You’re right. I elaborated on this in the post I linked to (“Welcome to Bitcoin Island”). In that piece, I stress that the things you’re spending are Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) — and it’s the traceability of these that leads to the “not perfectly fungible” claim.
2) Yes – I had to keep things in this intro article in order to get across the key ideas. But you’re right: the sidechains need to be secured. But how that happens is a matter for the sidechain. If somebody can produce a false “proof” that the locked Bitcoins should be released on the Bitcoin side then that’s a problem for the sidechain, of course (somebody presumably just had their coins stolen!) but it’s irrelevant (at a macro level) on the Bitcoin side.
Gendal, how do you suppose private chains will be secured? For example, the CEO may decide to adjust history and there is not much stopping him, since he controls all the mining. One approach is the periodic checkpoints sent to the blockchain. Anything else?
@tetsu – not sure what you mean. My reading of the sidechains paper is that the worst case scenario is that an attacker manages to “reanimate” Bitcoins on the main blockchain that had been sent to the sidechain… but that would be the attacker stealing the coins from the rightful owner on the sidechain. From Bitcoin’s perspective, the coins were always going to be reanimated…. so the risk is entirely borne by the holder(s) on the sidechain. Am I missing something?
@gendal I am discussing private chains with prospects, so my interest is not superficial and theoretical. I see the benefits for the organization in using the private chain as another form of internal database, with better security properties. It can also be used where a service bus product would be today, to facilitate integration, conformance, monitoring, audit. Private chain can also, via a two way peg, be connected to the main chain, achieving a form of network divide that routers created for us in the early stages of the Internet development. Anything else on the benefits side that I missed?
Buy what is lost with private chains is non-repudiation of transactions, as PoW can now be manipulated, by the company itself, hackers and the governments. Checkpointing with the main chains is a good start, but is not enough. I am interested in discussing possible solutions to the problem.
@Tradle. Thanks for elaborating. I’m also thinking about these things – and hear lots of other people talk about them – but I *really* struggle with the concept. It all comes down to the table I drew in this post: 
My take is that the Bitcoin architecture is a solution to the problem of how to maintain consensus about a ledger when the participants are unknown and many of them are adversarial (I know this is loose language… computer scientists working in the consensus space are more precise but I think this captures the essence…. i.e. we’re explicitly in a world where there is no “leader” and no identities for those providing the consensus services).
2) Yes – we know the Bitcoin architecture makes no objective sense here but we’re betting a whole ecosystem will grow up around this architecture and so it will likely become dominant, even in domains where it’s not optimal. There’s no point trying to fight the tide
3) No, Richard… you’re missing the point! We *do* have these problems inside the firewall. Security is so bad, employees are so untrustworthy, etc., that the problem statement for Bitcoin applies just as much *within* the firewall! We *really* need some sort of append-only data structure
I’m sensing your line of thinking is motivated by a bit of both 2) and 3), right? Assuming so, I think you’re right to highlight the critical question: without a diverse pool of miners, you don’t get any of the security “guarantees” of Bitcoin so securing an “internal” block chain becomes non-trivial. Any thoughts on how one might do this?
2) Yea, blockchain could be a suboptimal MQ Series, a slower append only persistent wire that has a lot of ready-made tools for audit and security analysis (ecosystem argument). As blockchain ecosystem grows all kinds of data transformation tools will appear (e.g. we are working on such). Inside blockchain could be tuned to be less PoW intensive and to cut blocks faster. Besides, the variations of PoS or a hybrid PoW + PoS scheme are emerging which could use the fact that inside, as you say, all network participants can have clear identities, unlike on the public bitcoin’s blockchain.
3) the argument ‘let’s harden internal IT as if it worked outside the firewall’ makes a ton of sense to me. We need to construct a lot of hoops for hackers to jump through, as permitter defense is not holding up anymore. And we need to make our systems anti-fragile. The blockchain data structure is a good tool, other P2P tools can be used too. Also, the blockchain has initiated a renaissance of crypto tech, like multisig, payment channels., HD wallets, hot-cold storage, and other innovations in key management.
– pervasive compartmentalization: store data on-chain encrypted with per-transaction keys. Store only what is necessary for the immediate access in a decrypted form (on encrypted drives) in a database (sort of like cold and hot wallets). When homomorphic encryption matures even DB records could be encrypted.
– verify requests based on a chain of prior activities instead of a naked access token (drawing inspiration from bitcoin’s cumulative DMMS, as described in a sidechains whitepaper). Each network participant will incorporate either a full node or an SPV client instead of trusting the access token.
New organizational structures will emerge that will make much less clear. These clear boundaries started to erode with the extranets in the 90s, then with the multi-tenant cloud platforms, and lately with the smartphones and the IoT. As we move forward we will see value chains where participants have multiple roles and affiliations. We will be designing token based systems that produce gains for any participants, internal or external.
@tradles – really thought-provoking… thanks. One clarification… when you say “security credentials on-chain” or “identities… on-chain”, what do you mean? I hear a lot about “block chain for identity”, etc,. but I’m not 100% sure I understand what it means!
– we provide no uniqueness of names, unlike the domain registrars, social networks, namecoin, onename.io, etc. There is no uniqueness of names in real life either. Instead the identity is just a hash of a [json] object that contains a public key. Identity object can not be modified directly, but a new version of it can be created, pointing to a previous version. The owner of the identity object can optionally connect it with the real life credentials, e.g. the social account, internet domain, email, etc. by proving the proof of ownership of that account the way onetime.io does it, the way Google Analytics does it, etc. This allows a spectrum of identities from fully anonymous to fully disclosed and verified. This also allows a person to have multiple identities, for work, for social, for gaming, for interest-specific forums. To simulate OAUTH2, a new site-specific identity can be created and signed with person’s other identity.
@tradles… OK – so I can create as many identities as I like (each with its own public key) and can associate them with identities on other services….. fine. I’m probably being really dumb – but where does the block-chain fit in to this? What are you storing? The hash of the JSON object? (To what end)? The JSON object itself? Something else?
Mastercoin and Counterparty are embedded consensus protocols (or meta-protocols) that use the blockchain to store their transactional data. Bitcoin devs, except Peter Todd who was hired by both teams to help them find a proper solution, are very unhappy, to say mildly, about storing the data on the blockchain. Heated discussions on this topic go on for hundreds of pages on bitcointalk and Mastercoin github issue. Mining pools like Eligius started censoring Mastercoin transactions (not sure if they are continuing with this practice right now, but the operators of this pool are adamant that data do not belong to the blockchain).
I think this conservative position without offering an alternative solution, will result in bitcoin ceding the market to Ethereum, much like Apple created an entrance to a much inferior at the time Android by signing an iPhone exclusivity deal with some carriers.
I talked yesterday with Adam Krellenstein of the Counterparty and censorship was threatened, but he said did not yet happen. Yet, as I gathered, it is a remaining concern that can undermine their whole business.
Thus Tradle set out to build a meta-protocol that saves the data in the overlay network, and only puts minimal referencing data on the blockchain. There is a general grumpy consensus among bitcoin core devs and mining pool operators on allowing one small data chunk, a hash, per transaction. Many devs say it is not possible to secure this second overlay network. I agree, unless we use the blockchain to help with the task. We have a partial solution working, and are preparing a new design to improve it (partial, as it can not yet handle all known attacks). We are actively sharing the designs at various meetups (and on the github) and are inviting devs to find attack vectors and propose solutions. Tradle’s protocol not only relieves the pressure on bitcoin’s blockchain but is also able to handle larger transaction sizes than Counterparty and Mastercoin, so it can be used for complex identity, supply chain management and many other applications. It is also capable of handling attachment files, needed in the healthcare and financial industries.
@tradles – thanks for taking the time to explain this. OK – so I get the debate around blockchain bloat and the (grudging) inclusion of OP_RETURN, etc., but what I’m missing is that I can only really see one scenario where embedding any identity data into the blockchain makes sense…. and that’s when I want to *associate* an identity with a transaction I’m performing.
I guess this could work in a world with address reuse. But, in the general case, would it mean you’d need thousands of certificates (one per address you plan to use?). Or am I missing something? Or perhaps there’s some clever maths (building on the math in HD wallets perhaps?)
@gendal, good question. Think of the identity hash as a bitcoin address, it is indeed public. So to assert anything with this identity you need to sign the object you are creating or changing with the identity’s private key. Specifically it is a private key that corresponds to a public key that you published in your identity’s object (json). The signature is not placed on the bitcoin transaction, as OP_RETURN has only 40 bytes. The signature is added to a [json] object that is modified with this identity. If you see any fault with this, please let me know.
There is a whole other issue of identity theft that needs to be addressed. Just a short note here as this is a big subject: If the private key to identity object is stolen, the true owner of the identity needs to have a way to change the key. One approach to that would be to use the private key of the bitcoin transaction that created the first version of the identity object. Another way could be to prove the ownership of other public keys on the identity object, like the one used for encryption (PGP key management suggests a separate key for each purpose, signing, encryption, etc.). Other non-automatic ways could include a trusted third-party, social proof, etc.
thank you for the clear explanation of this. so in essence, by locking bitcoins to a particular address we’ve created an asset (collateral). then on the other sidechain (marketplace) we get issued shares against the asset, which we can sell. anyone holding a share can then redeem it against the asset. I think that’s an analogy that finance types would get

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property

*Smart property* is property whose ownership is controlled via the Bitcoin block chain ( ) , using contracts ( ). Examples could include physical property such as cars, phones or houses. Smart property also includes non-physical property like shares in a company or access rights to a remote computer. Making property smart allows it to be traded with radically less trust. This reduces fraud, mediation fees and allows trades to take place that otherwise would never have happened. For example, it allows strangers to loan you money over the internet taking your smart property as collateral, which should make lending more competitive and thus credit cheaper.
Primitive forms of smart property are already common - if you own a car, it probably comes with an immobilizer. Immobilizers augment the physical key with a protocol exchange ensuring only the holders of the correct cryptographic token can activate the engine. They have dramatically reduced car theft, for example, immobilisers are fitted to around 45% of all cars in Australia, but account for only 7% of the cars that are stolen.
Many other forms of modern property are protected against theft using cryptography, for example, some smartphones will refuse to release certain keys if the correct PIN unlock isn't entered, and cryptography not only renders a stolen device fairly useless but makes it impossible to steal someone's phone number as well.
Although these are victories for cryptography, the potential of cryptographically activated property has not been fully explored. The private key is usually itself held in a physical container (like a key or SIM card) and can't be easily transferred or manipulated. Smart property changes this, allowing ownership to be intermediated by Bitcoin miners.
Let's start with the example of a car. The cars computer requires authentication using an ownership key. The ownership key is a regular Bitcoin ECDSA-256 key. The car starts its life at the factory gate with the public part of a newly created ownership key. A small token amount of Bitcoins are deposited on that key, call the amount T (it could be 0.0001 BTC for example). Additionally the car has a digital certificate from its manufacturer, and an identification key which has the public part in the certificate. This allows the car to prove things like its existence, age or mileage to third parties.
* The seller gives the car that nonce, and the car returns a data structure signed with its identification key. The data contains the nonce, the cars public cert, data about the car, the public key of the current owner, and the transaction+merkle branch which transferred ownership last time. This ensures the buyer knows what they are getting and that it came from the real seller (it's not a replay).
* The buyer creates a transaction with two inputs and two outputs. The first input signs for P coins. The second input is connected to the output holding T coins for the ownership address. The first output sends P coins to k1 and the second output sends T coins to k2. This transaction is not valid because only the first input can be signed. The buyer passes this partially complete transaction to the seller, who then signs the second input with the car's current ownership key and broadcasts the transaction.
* The buyer presents the car with the Bitcoin transaction, a merkle branch linking it to the block header and then enough block headers to fill in the gap from the cars current ownership transaction. The car sees that the new transaction re-assigns ownership and is further along in the chain than its current one, plus it has enough work piled on top to be sure the tx won't be reversed. It then updates its ownership information. The car does not need to keep a full record of the chain nor all headers, but rather just enough data to be able to connect future block headers to the one it was previously presented with.
In practice this process would likely be handled using smartphones with NFC hardware -- the act of touching the phone containing the ownership key to the dashboard would start your wallet app in a special mode that knows how to do smart property trades, after inputting the price the buyer and seller would then touch their phones together to finalize the deal. Although the cryptography is complex they would never need to know anything about it. The phone could double as a way to start the car as well.
Being able to trade physical property without fraud risk is useful, but we can add an extra layer to allow for secured low-trust loans. Consider a loan with which to start a small business. Rather than deal with a bank, you decide to allow people from around the world bid on your debt so you can get the best rates. For this to work, the strangers need some assurance that if the loan is not repaid, they get to keep the collateral - yet you still need to be able to use the car to set up the business.
We can do this by adding access keys to the ownership key. By signing a message with the ownership key, access keys can be added or removed. Access keys can be temporary in nature. This means that for the duration of the loan, you can re-assign ownership of the vehicle to the creditor whilst keeping an access key for yourself.
* The creditor signs Tx1 that has an re-assigning ownership of the car back to the debtor which is signed with SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, and an output for L coins to k1. This transaction is not valid because the loan has not yet been repaid, so the output sums to more value than the inputs. The creditor sends this transaction to the debtor who keeps it.
* As the debtor re-earns the money they spent, they add inputs to Tx1 to increase its value. This doesn't break the signature on the ownership key pair because it was signed with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY so is independent of other inputs. They can't adjust the outputs or anything else about the transaction because that would invalidate the ownership (SIGHASH_ALL).
Because access keys can be given time limits, if the debtor does not repay the loan by its maturity period his access key expires and the car will no longer start for him. The new owner can now either come and pick it up himself, or if he doesn't want to (eg he is in another country), he can sell it using the low-trust sales protocol described above and collect the money that way.
For expiring access keys, the device must have a trustable source of time. Some devices like cars and phones keep time by themselves. In other cases where that's not practical for some reason, a secure timestamping service can be used. This is a service that signs a message containing the current time and a nonce. The device generates a nonce, and as part of the protocol, a network connected device like a smartphone sends the nonce to the timestamping service then hands back the signed message. The block chain itself cannot be used as a source of time because there's no aspect - the device has no way of knowing if you've handed it the latest blocks or not. Signing the time with a nonce solves this.
Smart phones play a key role in smart property because they have the ability to bridge devices without network access to the network, using Bluetooth or NFC radio. For instance, requiring internet access for a smart lock on a house door is too expensive and impractical. However, a lock with an NFC touchpoint that understands how to check block header progression is quite feasible. The only operations needed to implement Bitcoin-linked smart property is hashing, ECDSA and a small amount of storage. Smartcard chips that implement everything required are common and cheap.----




https://www.ethereum.org/

Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet.
Today, billions of people can’t open bank accounts, others have their payments blocked. Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) system never sleeps or discriminates. With just an internet connection, you can send, receive, borrow, earn interest, and even stream funds anywhere in the world.
Ethereum isn't just for digital money. Anything you can own can be represented, traded and put to use as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can tokenise your art and get royalties automatically every time it's re-sold. Or use a token for something you own to take out a loan. The possibilities are growing all the time.
Today, we gain access to 'free' internet services by giving up control of our personal data. Ethereum services are open by default – you just need a wallet. These are free and easy to set up, controlled by you, and work without any personal info.
Ethereum and its apps are transparent and open source. You can fork code and re-use functionality others have already built. If you don't want to learn a new language you can just interact with open-sourced code using JavaScript and other existing languages.----

Altcoins have been described as the experimental laboratory of the cryptocurrency world But what if you could have an Altcoin ecosystem that offered the innovation, but was still at its core Bitcoin?

https://gendal.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/welcome-to-bitcoin-island/

Second, it helps us put some intuition behind the concept of the “ unspent transaction output ( ) ”.  These are Bitcoins that have been sent somewhere but not yet themselves been spent.  So the set of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) can be thought of as the latest state of every Bitcoin that has ever been mined.
But the interesting thing is: if we take a “land interpretation” of Bitcoin, then UTXOs have a really simple explanation: they are plots of land ! And Bitcoin transactions are simply actions that merge or split these plots of land.
Imagine I own twenty Bitcoins. My Bitcoin wallet software will show a “balance” of twenty. But it’s likely that this balance actually consists of multiple unspent-transaction outputs. Even if I had bought all twenty Bitcoins in one go, it’s likely that the seller merged several smaller UTXOs that added up in total to twenty Bitcoins.    So perhaps I received three plots of “land”: 7 Bitcoins in one, 7 in another and 6 in the third.  My total “holdings” are 20 – but it is formed from three “UTXOs”.
* Step Three: I need to specify what the new “owners” will need to do to prove they do indeed own the coins. In other words, I need to specify what they will need to do in their Step one when they try to spend their coins in the future.
I will set the conditions so that only the seller of the car could satisfy the Y condition and so that only I could satisfy the X condition (that’s my change and I don’t want anybody else spending it!)
But we can go further… we can now have an informed discussion about what “ownership” means in Bitcoin.  When I “send” Bitcoins to somebody, I’m not assigning ownership to an individual.  What I’m actually doing is laying down a condition – and anybody who can satisfy that condition will be considered the owner.
The land analogy works because Bitcoins are not perfectly fungible. Sure – there are projects trying to overcome this but this feels like an arms race between developers and law-enforcement agencies. To the extent that fungibility remains imperfect, what drivers could force different “land parcels” to have different values?
I see these schemes as directly analogous to concepts like land “ blight ( ) ” on the one hand and maybe “ planning gain ( ) ” on the other.  For example, if you own a “plot of Bitcoin land” that has been “whitelisted” by an exchange or finance firm such that you can access their services, presumably your “plot” would be worth more than one that didn’t have that property?
Two pieces of seemingly identical land can be worth vastly different sums: if one is sitting on oil and the owner has mineral rights, a purchaser will be willing to pay them more for their land than if it didn’t! Perhaps this is a useful analogy for colored coins: two identical Bitcoins can trade for different prices if one of them has been “colored” by a trusted issuer. What are the taxation implications? What happens when projects trying to add coin coloration to Bitcoin conflict with projects trying to create fungibility?
This interpretation now helps us think more clearly about the role and value of altcoins.   Perhaps the innate characteristic of a currency (faster confirmation? Use of scrypt?) makes the island a more attractive place to live. But if all the infrastructure and population is on Bitcoin Island then these features may not be enough.  Who knows.
It is possible to impose conditions on land parcels in many jurisdictions. A mortgage company can prevent sale of land unless the debt is settled and some landowners in the UK have been dismayed to discover that their land ownership came with an expensive obligation to pay for the upkeep of a local church ( ).
Of course, the land analogy is imperfect but I do think there is something to it.  If nothing else, the mental image of “Bitcoin Island” with UTXOs being the plots of land feels like a really useful one… it has certainly helped my understanding…
To answer your question: no, you can’t write a transaction such that whoever spends the UTXO must impose the same condition on their transaction output (but you might be able to in future). Bitcoin scripting currently doesn’t allow any reference to anything except the data contained in the script. You can’t reference any other data about the transaction itself or any other transaction.
There are some discussions in the development community about how to add smarter functions into scripting which will allow these sort of smart The problem is that adding these functions while maintaining security, backwards and forwards compatibility is very difficult. We will see alt-coins adding this functionality, most notably Ethereum which aims to allow the creation of extremely complex contracts.
@Albert…. I would argue the opposite… changing the 21M cap would be *extremely* difficult…. you would need to gain support of over 50% of hashing power *AND* convince everybody else that the change didn’t fundamentally undermine the system (or else risk a mass exodus of i.e. you’d need both to gain the support of a diverse group of miners *and* win a war of hearts-and-minds with the extended community. Anybody with a vested interest in the status quo would be lined up against you.
Do you really need to convince 50% of the mining power, or just fork the software? Also I bet the miners would go for it as it would mean more coins for them. Who is in charge of the software? People. I would not underestimate the power of greed. 🙂
I would suggest a better analogy would be Virtual Real Estate being the Domain names. They are unique and have little impact in carrying or holding costs until demand and development occurs. Value can be transferred to the acquiring party along with each unique identity and the Domain name remains the same.
Richard, the land analogy is a fruitful aid to concept development in BitThink. The blockchain and its associated miners takes on the role of the title registrar in a Torrens land registry. The elimination of the double-spend problem is equivalent to the Torrens attribute of indefeasibility of title or ownership. Since the spread of this idea from the state of South Australia in 1858 to Western Canada in 1861, the adoption of this method of land registry has been most rapid in land rush and gold rush jurisdictions. Bitcoin only recently emerged from its own land rush stage with Laszlo Hanyecz’s historic 10 May 2010 purchase of the 10 000 BTC Father John’s pizza. The blockchain is our title registry. The parallels are rich and in need further thought mining…
@eric – thanks for the comment. I’m not sure your analogy works, however: the important piece (for me) is inspiring a mental model that brings the UTXO concept to life. So you need some idea of consuming one or more inputs, producing one or more outputs and in so doing reallocating the As other commenters have said, it’s not possible to trace from input to output with certainty so my analogy doesn’t work perfectly. But I think you do need some idea of Or perhaps I misunderstood your point?
@canadense1 – agree land registry is a very useful parallel…. But perhaps Torrens is only part of the story? i.e. you can look at the blockchain to see which “address” currently owns a UTXO… but you can also see the full chain of title going back to one or more coinbase transactions…. so it’s a bit like *both* land registration systems at the same time!
Richard, in the Bitcoin protocol there is no need to trace the chain of ownership, although it is certainly feasible to do so. The innovations of the Torrens asset registry are the “mirror” principal and the “curtain” principle, meaning that indefeasible title is established without the necessity of tracing the chain of prior ownership, although one can readily do so.
A large part of the expense, and risk, in the present funds transfer system is the necessity of maintaining the chain of transfer for liability reasons and AML risks not to mention forensic accounting for taxation and fraud risk. Bitcoin’s chain certainly can be employed in this manner, but the critical insight comes to us in recognizing that the transfer and its attendant costs do not require that the chain be traced after it is secured in the blockchain.
This is the critical feature that also distinguishes a Torrens registry from the older costly and cumbersome chain-of-deeds asset registry. The insight here, which I shall not further dwell upon, is that both Bitcoin and Torrens solve the double-spend problem in a profoundly transformative manner, quite apart from surface appearances.
I would argue regarding the 21M BTC cap, that based on it’s design there is no need to add to that number, and create an inflationary environment. Why is this even brought up? We need to focus on (and I’m certain it is) a universal automated accounting solution, at least for Americans still here, to handle the capital gains tax so it’s not a deterrent to continued wide acceptance. I’ve heard blockchain.info and some wallets are able to easily make the calculations, but I haven’t heard for sure.
@canadense1 – thanks for the extra information. What’s your view on “coin tainting”  projects? It strikes me that, at heart, they’re all about trying to defeat the curtaining principle, as you call it…. i.e. they seek to look “beyond” the last transaction and impute properties to today based on something that happened in the past. Did I get that right?
Hi Richard. I realise this was written some time ago. This is an interesting analogy to help understand Bitcoin. I just want to point out that your example involving the 20 received bitcoin may be misunderstood. Some readers may be led to believe that the 20 bitcoin you bought “in one go” actually exist as three separate UTXOs in your wallet when in fact we know that it will really be just one UTXO of 20 bitcoin.----




http://siliconangle.com/blog/2014/10/29/bitcoin-weekly-2014-october-29-bitcoin-sidechains-the-bits-debate-scams-and-frauds-g-bitcoin-community/

This week in Bitcoin is still overshadowed by last week’s Bitcoin sidechains AMA by the authors of a vastly popular whitepaper on this technology that might fundamentally change how the Bitcoin protocol can be used.
Scams can be fairly prevalent in the wild, wild west of BTC–even as it slowly gains mainstream adoption (or perhaps because of that approach to the mainstream) so its important to know how to tell who is good and who is bad so we take a look at BadBitcoin.org.
The Bitcoin market has been seeing a continued downward trend since the last Bitcoin Weekly falling to around $340 from almost $385. Last week around Oct 22 the market value of BTC had reached $385, but then quickly dropped to a band around $355; however today, the value fell even further to around $340.
Last week, two Bitcoin core devs and other extremely smart people made a splash in the Bitcoin community with the release of a white paper on Bitcoin sidechains ( ) : a concept that allows the construction of blockchains that provide external functionality to Bitcoin but remain entangled with Bitcoin itself.
The whitepaper announcement came along with the revelation of Blockstream ( ) , a business co-founded by several of the authors of the whitepaper dedicated to innovating around the idea of sidechains.
The sidechain whitepaper and Blockstream both have a very strong lineup of people involved including Bitcoin core developers Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille. While the authors of the whitepaper and Blockstream’s founders are not entirely the same people, there is some overlap.
The whitepaper announcement opened with a Reddit AMA ( ) and this led to a sweep of the news media and community with articles from SiliconAngle ( ) , CryptoCoinsNews ( ) , TechCrunch ( ) , and CoinDesk ( ). As well as blogs working to demystify the entire meaning of and concepts behind sidechains such as this excellent article by Gendal ( ).
Scams happen. It’s important for anyone getting into or experienced in the Bitcoin ecology to develop a strong scam-radar and there’s a few tools out there to assist. One of those tools, BadBitcoin.org ( ) , tries to upkeep a list of suspicious sites that users should be on the lookout for.
It would appear that BadBitcoin has a hair trigger; however, the frontier of Bitcoin is an extremely fertile ground for scams so this could be seen as a good thing. A quick sampling of the most recent alerts is more or less a scattershot of sketchy sites—and looking at a random sampling it’s obvious why BadBitcoin thinks they’re suspicious.
The site includes a full blown “ Bad List ( ) ” and even tips on how to avoid scams ( ) and how to identify iffy sites. The site operators also run a Twitter account that emits recent scams ( ) in bite-sized notices as well as point to blog posts about the current temperature of the community.
The only criticism really for this site is that it would be useful for the site to provide some sort of factual presentation of what landed each site as a scam on the list. For the most part the Bad List contains snarky one-liners either calling the site a scam or noting some tidbit. Although some of the more egregious offenders do appear to receive a rogues gallery treatment (such as one interestingly named Michael Moriarty) but this is not the norm for entries.
Remember: BadBitcoin.org is only one of a constellation of tools that Bitcoin users should use when assessing the safety of a Bitcoin-related investment, exchange, or merchant. Keeping in mind this basic guide from Dr. Bitcoin ( ) is a good start for anyone new (or old) involved in the Bitcoin community.
Currently 1 BTC is approximately $355 and the result of this is that a $2 coffee is therefore around 0.0056 BTC. Many people believe this is an unwieldy number and solutions persist such as speaking in mBTC (one-thousandth of a bitcoin) or other variants; but the most recent topic of discussion is Bits (one millionth of a bitcoin, alluded to by core developer Gavin Andresen in a recent Reddit AMA ( ).)
As is the way of these things a Reddit discussion cropped up around the suggestion ( ) to address the usage of Bits instead of BTC. As a “bit” is essentially 1 uBTC (one microBTC) it could be forwarded as the colloquial term for a microbitcoin rather than having to say the entire unwieldy word.
There is already precedent in some of the Bitcoin community for using metric bitcoin values. BitcoinAverage.com ( ) has, for almost a year now ( ) , allowed a display in both BTC or mBTC (milibitcoins) to judge the current average market value of bitcoins. This is useful because it may be easier to judge the value of a bitcoin purchase when 1 mBTC is $0.56 versus 1 BTC being $355.
The psychological reason to adopt a metric bitcoin fraction is because many people have difficulty participating in bitcoin transactions when small fractions of a single bitcoin must be transferred for most daily uses. Most currencies, such as dollars, are exchanged in bulk for services and products such as $100 for a TV; which becomes cumbersome when someone needs to supply 0.281 BTC for the same product.
Debates over mBTC, Bits, etc. have not been uncommon in the community and no consensus has yet been reached on how to handle the issue. To become a cultural phenomenon, however, developers of exchanges, merchant financial services, mobile apps, etc. will have to buy into widespread use of mBTC, Bits (uBTC) or whatever other standard before any sort of adoption can take place.
The milestone was hit October 15, 2014 and the community has continued to grow since and now reaches over 10,685 members. The community has been running since 2012 on G+ and is a constant source of Bitcoin news, amusement, and discussions travelling through bitcoin circles. A must-visit for anyone interested in Bitcoin with a Google account.
“I had to not just manage the community but also be the ‘host’ and one of the most active users of it,” Avatar X ( ) , host and founder of the community, said in a message to SiliconAngle about curating the Bitcoin Community. “That way content did got in daily. And in turn attracted people to join and post.”
Avatar started the community in 2012 and has been one of the most common posters ever since. His careful gardening work has led to a bustling community brimming with news and good information. He explains that his high level of activity isn’t because he wants to dominate the conversation, but because he wanted to to attract good content from other users (who certainly have taken up that mantle over the years.)
He maintains a host position to curate information to keep the spammers at bay; but also his constant attention provides the framework for the community to shine bright on G+ and thus bring in more participants.
Avatar hopes that within a year he can back off from posting daily and let the community run relatively on its own with him only posting once a week. He also looks forward to announcing the 150,000 member milestone.

http://btctheory.com/2015/01/05/the-revolution-of-bitcoin-banking/

One of the dirty secrets of the bitcoin world is that we are still in the 11th century of online exchange. Today bitcoiners are dealing with the classic issue that plagued humanity since at least the 7th century BC when the first piece of coinage were found ( ). Coins, as all physical objects, are subject to physical theft, confiscation, swindling, fraud, and debauchment; but most of all, outright violence to seize it. These issues continue to this day; however there are apparatuses that as groups of people we can use to defend against such issues: Banks.
Banks from their earliest origins have functioned quite autonomously of the state. Developing out of the rise of italian merchant class in Italy during the 11th century, banking evolved far beyond the meager protection of precious metals into financialization. I highly recommend reading Nick Szabo’s two essays, “ Origins of the Joint-Stock Company ( ) ” and “ The Birth of Insurance ( ) ” for an in-depth look how this process occurred.
At this time, lending and banking was not a concern of the Sovereign–He had the power of taxation, and war–this was how he would raise funds if need be. However, war economies don’t work if you are on the losing side, and this is where the english crown found itself at the conclusion of the Nine Year’s War. England had been crippeled by france at the Battle of Beachy Head where the Royal Navy was decimated. William the III could not raise the funds at the time, and so he developed something very, very sneaky: The Bank of England. Of intersting note, this bank was built physically on top of a Roman temple of Mithras ( ) –how fitting.
As a private corporation, the BOE was given the sole power to issue bank notes in england on behalf of the crown. This allowed for lenders to give cash bullion to the bank, who could then give a loan based upon a promise of repayment from the Crown in the future. The Crown essentially invented war bonds to raise funds for the transformation of england into the naval superpower it would later become. And this was all thanks to the seditious revolution of banking.
Moving from a coinbased economy as the main mode of exchange ( ) , to a reserved-based note system, is what allowed for substantial economic development to occur in England in the generations after. This was specifically due to the technological development of new kinds of financialization which were never used before, which gave england a substantial economic advantage over other states.
Slowly and insidiously this version of banking took over the whole world! Using this system states could create money that did not exist yet; one could spend tomorrow’s promise of repayment today! A revolutionary development, but as we see today, when stretched beyond the limits of the markets, it can, and will create havoc.
Today in the bitcoin world, were are shuffling about our bitgold ( ) forged into coins from the process of bitcoin mining. You can read more about the production process of forging bitcoin in my previous post bitcoin as commodity money ( ) for a more detailed explanation of this process. While this does have many, many benefits over contemporary banking, fiat money, and governmental interference in economics; it also has substantial problems–mainly incompetence. From the Gox fiasco, to the most recent Bitstamp compromise ( ) , it is the golden age of digital highway robbery, with the Black Barts of the digital age having the time of their lives.
Attempting to move from a coinbase economy to a fractional reserve one does have some appeal, but we all know how problematic, and antithetical this is to bitcoin. However, with the developments going on over at Blockstream ( ) , I think there is real hope to create something that will straddle the lines between a coinbased economy, and a fiat economy: transparent reserve banking.
The team over at Blockstream ( ) has assembled a ‘Manhattan Project’ scale of crypto experts to develop sidechains ( ). The sidechain project is one to essentially be able to create a two-way peg between coins deposited, and the creation of new assets. There are two reason I believe this is such a critical development:
1) Using bitcoins deposited via sidechains a new assets can be created which would be more difficult to steal, and would allow some process of restitution in the case of theft, similar to what banks provide today.
Today those 10 BTC are worth around $2700, and once deposited with Alice bank, this will make a loan that is leveraged 1:10. Alice Bank will now give Bob a lump sum of $27,000 to be repaid in the future. In order for bob to recover his 10 BTC, he will need to make payment of $275 each month for 100 months. Bob is free to pay back the the loan + the fixed interest early if he chooses to do so. Once the total of $27,500 is fully repaid Bob will ‘unlock’ his bitcoin from the sidechain. Bob now has his 10 BTC back.
What makes this so revolutionary is that it solves the impossible trinity problem ( ) that all central banks face. This allows for a natural equalization of the USD value of bitcoin to occur through debt-financing via bitcoin, fixed in dollars. If the value of bitcoin substantially increases beyond the initial $270 that Bob’s bitcoin is financed at over the next 100 months, he will have all the more motive to repay quicker to get his bitcoin back. If bob defaults, Alice Bank will be able to keep the 10 BTC for itself.
If bitcoin is to advance itself beyond the wild west of digital finance, while remaining true to its core tenets we will need sidechains. This will allow for a revolution that will be similar to the scale and scope of the one William the III ushered in when he created the BOE. This will help bitcoiners resolve some of the security issues that have plagued the coin-based bitcoin economy, but more importantly, it will help financialize the bitcoin economy. By using bitcoin as an assest for debt-financing in fiat values, bitcoin banks will be able to create loans for people, while still remaining free from the hands of the state–if they choose to do so.

The value of the virtual assets is substantiated by a full reserve of real assets. And they are the first real-time transparent financial service in the history of the world. Check them out.

http://www.indiabitcoin.com/what-is-a-blockchain-sidechain-all-about-newsbtc/

If you’ve been keeping track of developments in the bitcoin industry, you’d know that the blockchain refers to the public ledger of transactions associated with the cryptocurrency. As the bitcoin ecosystem has grown in size and scale throughout the years, the blockchain has also increased considerably in length and storage size, prompting debates on whether or not to increase its block size limit ( ).
This has led to the concept of a sidechain, which are separate from the main bitcoin blockchain but would be interoperable with a two-way peg. This could allow for the transfer of assets between the sidechain and the main blockchain, without eating much storage space.
Apart from that, sidechains can enable innovators to safely develop new applications without jeopardizing bitcoin’s core code and putting billions of dollars worth of digital currency at risk. These have been discussed at length in the papers “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains” ( ) A and “A Simple Explanation of Pegged Sidechains” ( ).
A company called Blockstream has been focusing on these developments and has announced the release of Sidechain Elements, which is an open-sourced framework for sidechain development. It includes a functioning code and a testing environment for working with sidechains with several components: the core network software to build an initial testing sidechain, eight new features not currently supported by bitcoin, a basic wallet and the code for moving coins between blockchains.
Sidechains extend Bitcoin functionality through interoperable blockchain networks and today’s open source release includes an experimental sidechain that has a number of new working capabilities. With the release of Sidechain Elements, Blockstream is moving this effort into the community,” said Adam Back, co-founder and president of Blockstream.----




http://bitcointrading.net/bitcoin-developer-eric-lombrozo-on-five-benefits-of-segregated-witness/

Segregated Witness ( ) has become the most talked-about breakthrough in Bitcoin development since the concept was presented in early December to the Scaling Bitcoin ( ) Workshop in Hong Kong by Bitcoin Core ( ) Developer Pieter Wuille ( ). One of the men that Wuille thanked in the last slide of that presentation was Bitcoin Developer and Ciphrex ( ) CEO Eric Lombrozo ( ).
Lombrozo gave a presentation on the future of Bitcoin scalability at the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego ( ) , where he outlined some of the key benefits of Segregated Witness (SegWit). Although much of the Bitcoin community thinks of SegWit in terms of getting more transactions into each block, the reality is that this innovation offers more than that. When first mentioning this concept to the audience at the San Diego Convention Center, Lombrozo stated:
Lombrozo explained that SegWit allows nodes to ignore data that they were unlikely to use anyway. He added that this new feature would essentially free up more space for transactions in each new block ( ) :
Transaction malleability ( ) has been a thorn in the sides of Bitcoin developers for years. During the collapse of Mt. Gox ( ) , Mark Karpeles ( ) attempted to blame the loss of customer funds on this issue in the Bitcoin protocol. Transaction malleability has also been used to perform DoS attacks ( ) on the Bitcoin network.
A fix for transaction malleability is also required for the Lightning Network ( ) to function properly, so it’s possible that SegWit will be able to improve Bitcoin’s ability to scale in more ways than one.
Opcodes are what enable various types of transactions on the Bitcoin network. One of the most recent opcodes added to Bitcoin was OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY ( ). As a side note, new opcodes are required to bring sidechains ( ) functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain.
Validation on some transactions can be much lower than others, so it makes sense to allow users to choose the level of security they need in different situations. For example, someone purchasing their morning coffee does not require the same level of validation as a financial institution settling a day’s worth of transactions with another entity. Transactions with less validation can bring more efficiency and scalability to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it’s important to understand the security tradeoffs.
There may be some downsides to SegWit ( ) , too, but these advantages are hard to ignore. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic ( ) have plans for implementing this new concept into their respective software clients.

All of these new features may further solidify Bitcoin’s first mover advantage and network effect. The more utility the network has the higher the chances of its longevity. There are currently only several million bitcoin users so a boost in adoption will increase buying pressure on the limited supply.
In July of this year the bitcoin mining rewards will be reduced from 25 coins to 12.5. This will decrease the inflation rate from 9% to 4.5%. Our current rate of inflation releases 1,314,000 new coins annually. This adds over $500 million in selling pressure on the markets.
One way to measure user growth is to look at peer-to-peer volume transaction for services such as LocalBitcoins as well as Paxful. This tends to be organic buying pressure since most coins are sold at a premium and are not just traders shuffling the same coins.
Another way to measure user adoption is to determine how many accounts are registered with hot wallet services such as Coinbase. If their statistics are accurate then Coinbase has 3.6 million users. ( )

http://makikomi.jp/bitcoin/2016/05/20/features-from-the-most-popular-altcoins-are-planned-for-bitcoin/

For many people involved with Bitcoin, altcoins are nothing more than testnets. Hundreds of digital currencies are currently listed on CoinCap.io ( ) , but Bitcoin still dominates 78 percent of the market. In total, there are only 10 digital currencies with a current market cap of $10 million or more.
When looking at the most popular altcoins, it’s easy to see that there are some cryptocurrency features that are more desirable than others. Many have said that any altcoin with useful features will eventually see those features incorporated into Bitcoin. Up to this point, it’s clear that many of the most popular altcoins ( ) contain features that are similar to new improvements that are planned for Bitcoin.
Ethereum ( ) is the most successful altcoin in the history of digital currency ‒ at least when measured as a percentage of Bitcoin’s overall market cap. It was the second altcoin to ever reach a $1 billion market cap (after Litecoin ( ) ).
* Rootstock ( ) is a smart contract platform with similar goals to Ethereum. In fact, it is partially based on the combination of the Bitcoinj ( ) and Ethereumj ( ) clients. RSK Labs intends to implement the Rootstock project as a sidechain ( ) to Bitcoin; this means, while operating on a separate blockchain, Rootstock would exist in the Bitcoin currency network.
* Segregated Witness ( ) enables many new improvements ( ) to Bitcoin. One such improvement is the ability to more easily upgrade Bitcoin’s scripting language. At this year’s MIT Bitcoin Expo ( ) , Blockstream ( ) Core Tech Engineer Mark Friedenbach ( ) stated, “We could do something like Ethereum script, which is drastically different from Bitcoin script.” It should be noted that there currently do not appear to be any concrete plans to bring Ethereum script to Bitcoin via this method.
* Some Ethereum-based applications can also make their way to Bitcoin on their own. In this sense, a specific application is enabled on Bitcoin rather than the entire Ethereum platform. The best example here is Bitcoin Hivemind ( ). This project is the brainchild of former Yale statistician Paul Sztorc ( ) , and it’s a blockchain-based prediction market. A similar project, Augur ( ) (also mostly based on Sztorc’s work but without his support ( ) ), is one of Ethereum’s most highly anticipated applications.
* It’s possible that many of Ethereum’s use cases can also be implemented on Bitcoin via multisig ( ). This has been former Bitcoin Core ( ) lead maintainer Gavin Andresen ( ) ’s stance on Ethereum for quite some time ( ). In a recent AMA ( ) on Chinese Bitcoin community website 8btc ( ) , Andresen stated, “I think most of the interesting things you can do with Ethereum you can also do with multi-signature Bitcoin transactions.”
Dogecoin ( ) and Litecoin are two different digital currencies that are mostly used for low-value, low-security transactions. According to CoinGecko, these are the two most popular altcoins besides Ethereum. Although the Litecoin market cap was once over $1 billion, it currently sits below $200 million.
Bitcoin Alternatives: ** Sidechains and layer-2 protocols ( ) , such as the Lightning Network ( ) , are Bitcoin’s main alternatives to Dogecoin and Litecoin ‒ at least in terms of low-security, cheap alternatives to the Bitcoin blockchain. Of course, it should be noted that there may not be much of a security tradeoff in the case of the Lightning Network. These are still Bitcoin transactions.
Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell ( ) and Bloq ( ) co-founder Jeff Garzik ( ) recently shared countering viewpoints ( here for Maxwell ( ) and here for Garzik ( ) ) on which solution will work best for Bitcoin. It would be impossible for Bitcoin to replace Litecoin as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” but this is more of a marketing term than anything involving an actual use case.
Although they have different communities and features, the main selling point for both Dash ( ) and Monero ( ) is better privacy. Dash is currently the more popular altcoin on the market, although Bitcoin Core contributor and security researcher Peter Todd ( ) has publicly noted ( ) his preference for Monero. These two altcoins could face increased competition from the upcoming launch of Zcash ( ).
Bitcoin Alternatives: Better privacy has been a topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community for a long time. Implementing CoinJoin ( ) in Bitcoin Core has been discussed on the GitHub repository since 2013 ( ) , although the conversation has gained new life in recent months ‒ in large part thanks to JoinMarket ( ).
It’s possible that something like Confidential Transactions could be tested on a sidechain before being implemented on the main Bitcoin blockchain. This feature is already available on Blockstream’s Elements Alpha testnet sidechain ( ). Some members of the Blockstream team have also expressed their excitement regarding the prospect of a zerocash ( ) sidechain.
Although it appears many of the most popular features of altcoins will eventually find their way into Bitcoin, it’s important to remember that these are still very much works-in-progress. Segregated Witness, which is currently being tested and reviewed in the form of a pull request ( ) to Bitcoin Core, is a big step forward for these sorts of changes, and BIP 9 ( ) (Version Bits) should also be helpful ( ) as a new method of deployment for soft forks ( ).
Sidechains could be another major step forward ‒ eventually. The discussion as to how this functionality will be added to Bitcoin was recently started ( ) on the Bitcoin development mailing list ( ) by Sztorc. Rootstock plans ( ) to launch via a federated peg ( ) model at first, and it’s still unclear exactly when a decentralized, 2-way peg will be possible with Bitcoin.----




http://coinjournal.net/blockstream-cto-greg-maxwell-provides-update-bitcoin-sidechains/

The concept of sidechains ( ) was first brought to the public in the 99th episode ( ) of Let’s Talk Bitcoin ( ) back in April of 2014. While plenty of progress has been made since that first, conceptual announcement of the idea, the first true, decentralized sidechains are still not available on Bitcoin’s mainnet.
CoinJournal reached out to Blockstream ( ) CTO Greg Maxwell ( ) to get an update on the current status of sidechains, and he provided some insight into what can be expected over the next few months and what will eventually be made possible with this innovation.
As many bitcoiners know, there is currently a sidechains test network available in the form of Blockstream’s Elements Alpha ( ) project; however, this testnet is not the final vision of the sidechains concept. Maxwell noted, “[It] uses the full sidechains mechanism in one of the two peg directions, though not with compact SPV ( ) proofs.”
There is also still work to be done on the optimal design parameters for compact SPV proofs, which were outlined in the sidechains white paper ( ). Maxwell claimed, “After [work is completed on compact SPV proofs], we would then look to release a BIP ( ) with reference code for community feedback to start the open design and review process.”
Although sidechains are Blockstream’s pet project, there are also many other companies and individuals working on this concept. Bitcoin Hivemind ( ) ’s Paul Sztorc ( ) recently wrote about his concept of a drivechain ( ) , and Rootstock ( ) blogged ( ) about their own drivechain-sidechain hybrid model. To this point, Greg Maxwell stated
Although a representative from Blockstream claimed it was too early to comment on the drivechain idea, Maxwell did state that he is looking forward to a possible zerocash ( ) sidechain and other innovations. A non-Bitcoin version of zerocash, Zcash ( ) , is expected to be released this summer.
The main value of sidechains has been most-properly explained as a way to allow for more experimentation in the Bitcoin development process. For example, the upcoming Segregated Witness ( ) improvement came out of the Elements Alpha sidechain. In his comments to CoinJournal, Greg Maxwell revealed that he recently proposed a signature aggregation scheme that would reduce transaction sizes by 30 percent, which is another improvement that could be prototyped on a sidechain.
Some of the other sidechain-related projects to think about for now are Bitcoin Hivemind, Rootstock, a zerocash sidechain, and a sidechain for testing Confidential Transactions ( ) (another possible privacy improvement for Bitcoin).

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-part-how-a-clever-hack-could-significantly-increase-bitcoin-s-potential-1450553618

If one proposal excited attendees at the recent Scaling Bitcoin ( ) workshop in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream, it was developer Dr. Pieter Wuille's Segregated Witness. Praised by many within the technical community, Segregated Witness is expected to improve Bitcoin's performance in a number of ways, while some even hope it might be the scaling solution that helps bring some peace back to the Bitcoin community.
In order to understand Segregated Witness, it is helpful to understand what Bitcoin transactions are on a more technical level. (Feel free to skip to the last section of this article if this is a familiar subject.)
For starters, it's important to realize that the Bitcoin protocol, at its core, consists of transactions. Nodes on the peer-to-peer network don't send each other bitcoin; they send each other packages that contain transaction data.
These Bitcoin transactions, in a way, are really sets of “locks.” More specifically, each transaction contains two main components. One half effectively unlocks bitcoin that were locked up in previous transactions, using pieces of data called inputs. Inputs include scripts ( ) , instructions on how to unlock the input, called scriptSigs. The other half consists of one or several new locks called outputs , which lock the same amount or less bitcoin up again. Outputs include scripts called scriptPubKeys. As such, bitcoin effectively move from inputs to outputs within a single transaction, and jump from transaction to transaction at the same time.
There is one main exception to this rule. A coinbase transaction (not to be confused by the wallet company and exchange with the same name) is the transaction created by a miner when he finds a new block, and contains the block reward: currently 25 bitcoin. Additionally, a miner can increase the coinbase reward by any amount of bitcoin that was unlocked in transactions, but not locked up again: the difference between the inputs and the outputs. These are the transaction fees.
It is of vital importance that the rules used by all nodes to verify transactions are compatible with the rules used by (almost) all miners. If some miners would include transactions in blocks that other nodes reject, the whole block would be considered invalid by that node. If that node is also a miner, this could lead to double spends and network forks.
These consensus rules – the rules all nodes agree on – allow transactions to lock up (and unlock) bitcoin in several different ways at once. But outputs that lock up bitcoin typically, at least, include a scriptPubKey along the lines of: “Prove that you own (or: know) the private key ( ) that corresponds to the public key that corresponds to this Bitcoin address ( ).”
(It's easy to reproduce a public key from a private key , but it's basically impossible to reproduce a private key from a public key. Similarly, it's easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address from a public key , but it's impossible to reproduce a public ke y from a Bitcoin address. As such, it's also easy to reproduce a Bitcoin address from a private key , but impossible to reproduce a private key from a Bitcoin address. It's a “one way street.”)
The Bitcoin address used to lock bitcoin up in the scriptPubKey, of course, is the address provided by the receiving end of the transaction. Since the receiver created that address using a private key only he knows, he is the only one who can create a valid scriptSig, and therefore the only one who can create a new transaction and spend the locked up bitcoin.
To prove ownership of the private key that corresponds to the public key that corresponds to a Bitcoin address, one could theoretically include the private key in the scriptSig of a transaction. But, of course, that's not safe at all. Most importantly, anyone who sees the transaction could take the private key, and create a new transaction (or change the original transaction) to attribute himself as many bitcoin as are locked up before
Signatures are a cryptographic trick which uses a private key in combination with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. And, using the magic of cryptography, the corresponding public key can be used to verify that the signature was created using that private key. As such, signatures prove both ownership of a private key, as well as approval of a specific piece of data by the owner of that private key, all without actually needing to reveal the private key.
In Bitcoin's case, private keys are typically used to sign the transaction data minus the inputs. (Hence, the scriptPubKeys, the locked amounts, and some additional details.) Subsequently, this signature and the public key from which bitcoin are spent are added to the input field of the transaction. This proves that the owner of the private key really intended to create the transaction and makes sure it cannot be tampered with.
Then, all of this transaction data – including the inputs this time – is hashed ( ) together, which creates the transaction ID, identifying the specific transaction. If a transaction is subsequently included in a block, the miner hashes the transaction ID together with another transaction ID to produce a new hash. And this hash is hashed again, this time along with the hash from two other transaction IDs. This process continues until there is only one hash left. This structure of hashes is called a Merkle Tree ( ) , and the remaining hash the Merkle Root. This Merkle Root is combined with additional block data to form the block header , which is used to identify the specific block. A hash of this block header, finally, must be included in the next block’s header, chaining blocks together.
Bitcoin is considered immutable because changing any part of any transaction retroactively would alter the transaction ID, in turn altering the block header. But this altered block header would no longer meet the proof of work ( ) requirement. And since the block header influences the make-up of subsequent block headers, neither would any of those.
The Segregated Witness proposal as presented by Wuille in Hong Kong is based on a concept used in Blockstream's sidechain Elements ( ) , and a complementing idea by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. It was conceptualized over the past couple of months in cooperation with Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Eric Lombrozo, and might be rolled out over the next year.
As such, from the perspective of Bitcoin nodes that don't use Segregated Witness (lets call them “old nodes”), some newly created outputs might soon use a strange type of scriptPubKeys. Strange, because these scriptPubKeys can hardly be considered a lock at all. Commonly referred to as an “Anyone can spend,” these scriptPubKeys basically proclaim they don't require a signature. Additionally, they will include some meaningless text.
Old nodes will consider these transactions crazy. They will think that anyone can create a new scriptSig, unlocking these outputs, meaning they're highly insecure. But at the same time, old nodes won't mind either. After all, it's not their bitcoin that's being messed around with, and other people are free to do with their bitcoin as they please. The meaningless text will be considered weird, but fine too. So they'll confirm the transactions as valid, and forward it to other nodes.
However, Segregated Witness-enabled nodes (lets call them “new nodes”) will notice something else. They will see the otherwise meaningless text in the scriptPubKey, but not consider it meaningless at all. Instead, new nodes will recognize this piece of text as another – very special – type of output.
Much like typical outputs, this new type of output will require one or several signatures to unlock the bitcoin. But unlike typical outputs, this new type of output will not require the signature to be included in the scriptSig of a subsequent transaction. Instead, it will require the signature to be included in a completely new part of the transaction: the Segregated Witness.
This Segregated Witness is basically an “add-on” that carries signatures and some additional data. Importantly, Segregated Witnesses are completely ignored by old nodes, but recognized by new nodes. Moreover, the data they carry is not hashed along with the other parts of a transaction into the transaction ID.
As such, both old nodes and new nodes will consider transactions containing signatures in the Segregated Witness valid. Old nodes validate them because from their perspective these transactions don't require a signature at all (and they don't see one), and new nodes validate them because the required signature is in the Segregated Witness. And since both old and new nodes hash the transaction data into the same transaction ID, everyone agrees on the makeup of blocks, and, as such, on the structure of the entire blockchain.
(Note that it is important that all miners – or a very large majority – should use Segregated Witness in order to prevent double spends and chain forks, or none of them should. If all miners do use Segregated Witness, old nodes on the network might wonder why some transactions aren't included in blocks, but since it was always up to miners to decide which transactions to include, and since these are not their transactions, they won't mind, either.)
To make sure that signatures are embedded in the blockchain regardless, a Segregated Witness-enabled miner adds a trick, too. Rather than creating only a Merkle Tree out of all of the transactions, it also creates a Merkle Tree out of all Segregated Witnesses, to mirror the transaction tree. The Segregated Witness Merkle Root, then, is included in the input field of the coinbase transaction. As such the Segregated Witness Merkle Root changes the transaction data of the coinbase transaction, its transaction ID, therefore influences the block header and, ultimately, the makeup of the blockchain.----




http://insidebitcoins.com/news/blockstream-wants-to-make-bitcoin-more-private-with-confidential-transactions/33256

This news comes to us via an official Blockstream blog post ( ) , in which the company revealed they “believe that bitcoin holders and businesses involved in Bitcoin should take part in mining themselves, to help maintain the decentralized security of the Bitcoin network.”
The goal here is to make mining more accessible. As you may know, the barrier to cryptocurrency mining is quite high. It requires extensive knowledge of computer hardware, is expensive, and potential miners have to find the right space to participate.
“Blockstream Mining addresses these issues by providing a turnkey, enterprise-class colocation service,” the post reads. This enables “the customer to monitor and control their mining equipment with complete transparency.”
Started back in 2017, Blockstream was aware that “mining decentralization” was on the decline. “At the time it appeared that parties involved in ASIC ( ) manufacture, hosting, and pool operations were becoming a centralizing force and holding back Bitcoin from reaching its full potential,” the post reads.
Since then, the platform has upped its technology, brought in more avenues for mining power, and have become host to clients like the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, and Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn.

http://www.bitconio.net/2016/09/10/some-economists-really-hate-bitcoin/

The vast majority of economists seem to have a serious distaste for Bitcoin. Whenever an economist who has received a Nobel Prize, teaches at an Ivy League school or works at a central bank comments on Bitcoin, they always seem to have something negative to say about the technology. Some of these individuals simply say that Bitcoin has no future whatsoever, while others go as far as to claim it is pure evil.
Paul Krugman ( ) , who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics, has ridiculed Bitcoin on multiple occasions. Late last month, fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz ( ) shared his own disdain for the peer-to-peer digital cash system at the London School of Economics. Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff ( ) also recently spoke negatively of Bitcoin, saying the U.S. Government should eventually ban the digital money, in addition to cash bills over $10.
In 2014, Krugman went on to essentially call Bitcoin a scam ( ). In 2015, Krugman seemed to lack a basic understanding of Bitcoin ( ) when asked about it at The Genius of Economics ( ). “At this point, bitcoin is not looking too good,” he noted.
According to BitcoinAverage.com ( ) , one bitcoin was trading at $279.63 the day Krugman made that statement. The price has more than doubled since then and is now above $600. In fact, bitcoin hit the bottom of its current rally a little under two months before Krugman’s statement.
Of course, Krugman’s analysis wasn’t as blatant or specific as that of Boston’s University’s Mark T. Williams ( ) , who infamously predicted a collapse of the bitcoin price to under $10 by the middle of 2014 ( ).
Although Stiglitz hasn’t talked about bitcoin much over the years, he appears to hold a view similar to Krugman’s. “My own view is bitcoins have been greatly exaggerated, and a common medium of exchange ( ) and store of value ( ) is a basic public function and needs to be regulated,” he recently stated ( ) at the London School of Economics. “The main use of bitcoins has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation and I think the U.S. government did the right thing by trying to shut it down. And I think, effectively, it has done that.”
Stiglitz is correct in that the main use case of Bitcoin is for regulatory arbitrage ( ) (outside of its use as a store of value), but his comments regarding a U.S. government shutdown of Bitcoin are unfounded. It’s unclear what Stiglitz was referring to when he said the U.S. government tried to shut down (or effectively shut down) the peer-to-peer digital cash system.
Now for Rogoff. This Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University would like to see Bitcoin banned if it gains further traction. “You have to play whack-a-mole with all these things,” he stated during a recent appearance ( ) on CNBC. “There are always going to be these other things: gold coins, uncut diamonds, [and] now bitcoin.”
In a recent article for Project Syndicate ( ) , Rogoff claimed governments have many tools at their disposal for limiting the use of bitcoin. The one example tool he provided was a ban on the acceptance of bitcoin by banks and retail stores.
Although he doesn’t want to get rid of cash completely, Rogoff would like to gradually remove bills larger than ten dollars from circulation. This, obviously, would have the side effect of making bitcoin an even more attractive offering for censorship-resistant transactions. In fact, a cashless (or in Rogoff’s case, less-cash) society has the potential to create new opportunities for Bitcoin ( ).
Ironically, Rogoff hints at the opportunity a less-cash society could create for Bitcoin in his aforementioned article. “Scaling back paper currency would hardly end crime and tax evasion; but it would force the underground economy to employ riskier and less liquid payment devices,” he wrote.
The reasons these economists (and others) hate Bitcoin should be obvious. In their view, it is the government’s job to regulate currency in an effort to provide greater stability for the economy. They also clearly believe the government should be able to decide what is and is not a legitimate or legal transaction.
This point of view is cited in the posts by Krugman, mentioned earlier in this article. In both of those pieces about Bitcoin, Krugman links to a Charlie Stross blog post titled, Why I Want Bitcoin to Die in a Fire ( ).
In the piece, Stross complains about a variety of perceived issues with Bitcoin; including, the 21 million bitcoin cap, the amount of energy burned to secure the network, any possibility of anonymity or privacy within the system, how digital cash has incentivized the creation of new malware, uncensorable markets, and more.
“To editorialize briefly, BitCoin [sic] looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind — to damage states’ ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions,” Stross concludes.

http://shoutout.fintechna.com/2016/10/13/private-blockchain-or-database/

A #private blockchain ( ) is a system, commonly known as a “Distributed ledger” that has an access control layer built into the protocol [ 1 ( ) ]. This means the network participants have control over who can join the network, and who can participate in the consensus process of the #blockchain ( ).
This is in contrast to a public blockchain, which is open for all to participate in — as a user, as an entity that determines the validity of transactions, and the consensus process. Private blockchains, therefore have a very different level of security than public blockchains like #Bitcoin ( ) [ 2 ( ) ].
Private blockchains are a class of distributed ledgers that use transactions and blocks, first described in Bitcoin. Distributed ledgers are shared databases with access protection rights, with defined rules on what types of changes can be performed by what entities.
The value of distributed ledgers at the enterprise level arises from the ability to do away with the reconciliation of data among participating entities [ 3 ( ) ]. This is especially the case with financial institutions that trade with one another.
A lot of effort on the back-office today is spent in the reconciliation of records among different institutions [ 4 ( ) ]. Instead, distributed ledgers allow financial institutions to maintain a structurally consistent shared #database ( ) of transactions. This allows each participating institution to read data from the distributed ledger and be guaranteed that it is valid and reconciled against the data held by the other participating institutes.
The security of a public blockchain like Bitcoin comes from its proof of work, which makes it mathematically impossible to fake or reverse transactions without miners colluding, using the current state of #technology ( ) [2].
On the other hand, the security promises of distributed ledgers and private blockchains are only as good as the honesty of the entities validating the transactions. There are no mathematical guarantees behind the irreversibility of transactions in a private blockchain.
There is considerable debate in the community in the value of a private blockchain over a shared database. Some, like Prof. Arvind Narayanan of Stanford, contend that private blockchains are just another name for a shared database [ 2 ( ) ]. Others, like Gideon Greenspan of Multichain see several differences between private blockchain and SQL like databases, from disintermediation to robustness [ 5 ( ) ].
Traditional databases are completely contained within one entity, irrespective of their structure (SQL or no-SQL type databases). This includes read and write access, which is only possible via applications controlled by the entity to which the database belongs [ 9 ( ) ]. Shared databases, on the other hand, involve read and write access involving multiple entities.
The most popular such algorithms include Raft [ 7 ( ) ] and Juno [ 8 ( ) ]. These consensus protocols work based on a leader-follower model, wherein for each block a leader is selected who creates the block and adds to the blockchain. There are various ways in which errors and anomalies are then corrected by the system.
Shared databases in the past have suffered from the inability to prevent malicious activity. This would be the case, for example, when one of the participating entities is hacked, and that entity writes ‘corrupted’ data into the shared database, thus making it invalid for everyone involved.
In addition, the consensus protocols used by private blockchains today are “BFT Hardened”, such as Juno [ 8 ( ) ]. This improves the security features of the blockchain by protecting against insular hacking cases, thus preventing individual participants from acting in a malicious manner.
There are many reasons for this. Private blockchains scale significantly better than public blockchains [ 6 ( ) ] and the network parameters, such as network congestion and transaction fees are known in advance.
Also, banks and financial institutions are regulated entities that cannot operate over open protocols without performing due diligence of the parties involved in the transaction [ 10 ( ) ]. It is unclear whether regulations require miners to be identified for certain classes of transactions to provide settlement finality.
By their very nature, private blockchains require different entities to come together and agree to a common set of standards by which it will operate. This is challenging due to legacy inertia and due to the differing requirements of different participants in the system.
The future of these competing ideologies will be incumbent on issues of governance, scalability and reputation. These mandates will be required by incumbent institutions but conceived by innovative blockchain startups that see opportunity in mainstreaming the concepts of a blockchain, distributed ledger, and consortium chains.

https://captainaltcoin.com/blockchain-smart-contracts/

The *blockchain* ( ) is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties. One of the best things about the blockchain is that there’s no need to pay intermediaries (Middle men) and it saves you time and conflict. Blockchains have their problems. However, they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems. These are the reasons why banks and governments are turning to them. We can make business more efficient and make the legal system more equitable by giving computers control over contracts.
Imagine if you could make it easier to update your will, cut your mortgage rate, or ensure that your buddy was never able to weasel out of paying up on a bet? That and much more is the promise of smart contracts. Thanks to cryptocurrency smart contracts are a technology that is getting closer and closer to reality.
However, major questions abound as always with this cutting edge of financial technology: Will anyone actually use these things anyway? And, of course, how will this all align with our current legal system?
The idea of smart contracts goes way back to 1994. That’s when *Nick Szabo* ( ) , a cryptographer widely credited with laying the groundwork for bitcoin, realized that the decentralized ledger could be used for smart contracts, otherwise called self-executing contracts, blockchain contracts, or digital contracts. In this format, contracts could be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain and this would also result in ledger feedback such as receiving the product or service and transferring money.
Szabo’s original theories about how these contracts could work remained unrealized. The reason for this is that there was no digitally native financial system that could support programmable transactions. (If a bank still has to manually authorize the release and transfer of money the purpose of smart contracts is defeated). Phil Rapoport, Ripple Labs’ director of markets and trading says: “One big hurdle to smart contracts is that computer programs can’t really trigger payments right now.”
The advent and increasingly widespread adoption of bitcoin is changing that. As a result Szabo’s idea has seen a revival and smart contract technology is now being built on top of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
Smart contracts help you exchange money, shares, property, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way. The best thing is that smart contracts allow you avoid the services of a middleman.
Comparing the smart contracts to a vending machine is the best way to describe the technology. Usually, if you need some document you would go to a notary or a lawyer, pay them, and wait until you get the document. With smart contracts, on the other hand, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your driver’s license, escrow, or whatever drops into your account. This means that smart contracts define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does. This technology also automatically enforces those obligations.
Codius was developed by Ripple Labs. This company also created its own digital currency called Ripple. Although Codius is managed by the private company, it aims to be interoperable between a variety of cryptocurrency, such as Ripple and bitcoin.
Ethereum is originally developed by 20-year-old programmer Vitalik Buterin. It is an entirely new currency with smart contracts baked into its payment system and it would replace other “coins” like bitcoin, but appears to be more of a community project.
Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are poised to help smart contracts become reality, but the effect may also be reciprocal. Smart contracts can illustrate a unique benefit of virtual currencies that some lawyers think could attract more people.
Smart contracts can be used for all sorts of situations that range from credit enforcement to financial services, financial derivatives, insurance premiums, legal processes, crowd funding agreements, breach contracts and property law.
Here is the code for a basic smart contract. It was written on the Ethereum blockchain. Contracts can be encoded on any blockchain. However, Ethereum gives unlimited processing capability so it is mostly used.
Let’s take a simple example, like the NBA Finals bet. Say you want to bet $500–or roughly one bitcoin–that the Cavs will win. On the other hand, your friend is betting the same amount that the Warriors will take the title. Your friend and you should place your bitcoin in a neutral account controlled by the smart contract. The smart contract would automatically deposit your bet and your winnings from your friend back into your account when the game is over and the smart contract is able to verify via ESPN, CNN, or elsewhere that the Warriors beat the Cavs.
Smart contracts are computer programs. That’s why it would be trivial to add more complex betting elements like odds and score differentials into the mix. There are services out there today that might handle this sort of transaction. However, they all charge a fee. The key difference with smart contracts is that it doesn’t require any intermediary party because it is a decentralized system accessible to anyone.
Online shopping would be a more everyday example. You might not want to pay a merchant immediately if you order something online. You will pay them when they fulfil their end of the bargain. Before releasing payment to the sender, you could easily have a contract that looks for FedEx tracking data saying that the package you ordered has been delivered to your address.
Because of its accuracy, transparency, and automated system the blockchain not only provides a single ledger as source of trust, but also shaves possible snarls in communication and workflow. Usually, while waiting for approvals and for internal or external issues to sort themselves out, business operations have to endure a back-and forth. A blockchain ledger streamlines this and it also cuts out discrepancies that typically occur with independent processing. This may lead to costly lawsuits and settlement delays.
Insiders vouch that it is extremely difficult for our voting system to be rigged. However, smart contracts would allay all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Ledger-protected votes would need to be decoded and require excessive computing power to access but no one has that much computing power. Furthermore, smart contracts could hike low voter turnout. Much of the inertia comes from a fumbling system. This includes lining up, showing your identity, and completing forms. Volunteers can transfer voting online with smart contracts and millennials will turn out en masse to vote for their Potus.
“UPS can execute contracts that say, ‘If I receive cash on delivery at this location in a developing, emerging market, then this other [product], many, many links up the supply chain, will trigger a supplier creating a new item since the existing item was just delivered in that developing market.’” All too often, paper-based systems hamper supply chains. Here forms have to pass through numerous channels for approval and this increases exposure to loss and fraud. The blockchain provides a secure, accessible digital version to all parties on the chain to nullify this and automates tasks and payment.
Smart contracts can get you more money. Normally, you’d need to pay a middleman such as Craigslist or a newspaper to advertise if you wanted to rent your apartment to someone. You would also need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The ledger cuts the costs. All you do is pay via bitcoin and encode your contract on the ledger, everyone sees, and you accomplish automatic fulfilment. Anyone associated with the property game, like brokers, real estate agents, hard money lenders can profit.
We’re progressing from slothful pre-human vertebrates to super-smart robots and there is no doubt about it. Imagine a future where everything is automated and that’s where smart contracts help. The self-autonomous or self-parking vehicles are one example. Here, smart contracts could put into play a sort of ‘oracle’, the sensor or the driver, as well as countless other variables, that could detect who was at fault in a crash. An automobile insurance company could charge rates differently using smart contracts, based on where, and under which, conditions users are operating their vehicles.
Using a private key which would grant access only to specific individuals, personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted via HIPAA laws (in a secure and confidential way), which means that receipts of surgeries could be stored on a blockchain and automatically sent to insurance providers as proof-of-delivery. You can also use the ledger for general health care management, such as managing healthcare supplies, supervising drugs, regulation compliance, and testing results.
If you think about a lot of routine financial transactions, what lawyers and banks do boils down to repetitively processing mundane tasks and yet we still have to shell out huge fees for banks to process our mortgage payments or for lawyers to go through wills.
When you need mortgage you get it through a bank. However, that bank won’t generally hold onto your mortgage for the entire 30-year loan and your mortgage will be sold to an investor. But you don’t make payments to the investor that owns your mortgage. You keep making payments to the bank and the bank just becomes a processor for your monthly payments. The bank will send a slice to taxes, a chunk to the investor, and a bit for homeowner’s insurance.
“That’s just a real simple operational task. However, to service that mortgage, that bank will often take a quarter to a half percent per year, “says Rapoport. “They’re just doing an operational headache of receiving payments and redirecting them and they’re charging you for that. But it’s something that could theoretically be administered very easily with a smart contract. “
Mortgage processing fees could be eliminated and that savings passed on to consumers if mortgage payments were handled by smart contracts. The result would be a lowered cost of home ownership, which would be great for most people.
Smart contracts have clear potential, although they are still in their nascent stage. If a simple enough user interface were developed it could remove a host of legal headaches. For example, this can help you with updating your will. Imagine if allocating your assets after you die was as simple as moving an adjustable slider that determines who gets what. Just like with the bet or FedEx example, the contract goes into effect and your assets are divvied up once the smart contract can verify the triggering condition–in this case, your death.
Nonetheless, lawyers might have very different role in the future. The role of lawyers might shift to producing smart contract templates on a competitive market rather than having lawyers adjudicate individual contracts. Contract selling points would be their quality, their ease of use, and how customizable they are.
It’s easy to think about a smart contract managing a will and if you can imagine yourself keeping all of your assets in bitcoin it all makes sense. But what if you live in the real world and have physical possessions? The answer is something that we call smart property.
Ellis explained that this started to get more sci-fi when we talk about smart property. The so-called “Internet of Things” is constantly growing. It has more and more interconnected devices out there every day and some forward-thinking developers *are already working on* ( ) ways to combine the Internet of Things with bitcoin infrastructure. They want that something like a bitcoin can actually represent a physical object and that token is what these developers call smart property.
These new smart property tokens would actually grant ownership and control to a networked object, whether that be a computer, a car, or even a house. This is more important than representing some object.
Ellis gives the example of renting out his house: “Let’s say all the locks have got network connections, and they are all Internet-enabled. The smart contract you and I agreed to automatically unlocks the house for you when you make a bitcoin transaction for the rent and you just go in using keys stored on your Smartphone.”
Doing the same sublet with a smart contract would supplant Airbnb’s. The homeowner and renter just need to trust the smart contract and they still don’t need to trust each other. Smart contracts would decentralize the model of who needs to be trusted, which would cut out hefty fees by brokering services like Airbnb.
Smart contracts don’t have to just disrupt existing business models, they can also complement them. Nick Szabo envisioned the idea of smart property writing way back in his ’94 essay. He said that “smart property might be created by embedding smart contracts in physical objects.” His example of choice was a car loan. He said that the smart contract could automatically revoke your digital keys to operate the car if you miss a car payment. Car dealerships would definitely find this appealing.
*Autonomy* – You’re the one making the agreement. This means that there’s no need to rely on a lawyer, broker, or other intermediaries to confirm. Incidentally, since execution is managed automatically by the network, rather than by one or more, possibly biased, individuals who may err, this also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party.
*Speed* – To manually process documents, you’d ordinarily have to spend chunks of time and paperwork. Smart contracts use software code to automate tasks. This feature shaves hours off a range of business processes.
*Safety* – Cryptography, the encryption of websites, keeps your documents safe, which means that there is no hacking. In fact, to crack the code and infiltrate it would take an abnormally smart hacker.
Admittedly, it does start to sound like the makings of a dystopian sci-fi film at some point. Your car could be digitally and remotely repossessed if you can’t make a payment. This would be done without any human interaction.
Ellis said that at present justice really only works if you have enough money to hire a lawyer to enforce that agreement. So it will be game-changing once smart contracts have the ability to enforce agreements on their own.
Rapoport admitted that there may be drawbacks and he said that in some ways it’s easier to read a traditional contract because everyone reads in English. But this is still very bleeding-edge technology. This means that we don’t know what kinds of user-facing improvements will be made eventually.
Smart contracts are far from perfect and there is a lot to be learned about them. How should these contracts be regulated by governments? What if bugs get in the code? How would these smart contract transactions be taxed by governments? Remember my rental situation as a case in point.
What happens if I send the wrong code? Or, as lawyer *Bill Marino points out* ( ) , I send the right code, but my apartment is condemned before the rental date arrives? I could rescind it in court if this were the traditional contract. However, the blockchain is a different situation and the contract performs, no matter what.
Part of the future of smart contracts lies in entangling these problems. For example, in Cornell Tech ( ) there are some lawyers who insist that smart contracts will enter our everyday life. They have dedicated themselves to researching these concerns.
Actually, we’re stepping into a sci-fi screen when it comes to smart contracts. The IT resource center, Search Compliance *suggests* that smart contracts may impact changes in certain industries, such as law and lawyers will transfer from writing traditional contracts to producing standardized smart contract templates in that case. These templates are similar to the standardized traditional contracts that you’ll find on *LegalZoom* ( ). Other industries, like credit companies, merchant acquirers, and accountants may also employ smart contracts for tasks. They can employ them as real time auditing and risk assessments. In fact, the website Blockchain Technologies *sees* smart contracts merging into a hybrid of paper and digital content. Here contracts are verified via blockchain and substantiated by physical copy.
*NXT* ( ) : NXT is a public blockchain platform. It contains a limited selection of templates for smart contracts. It is important to note that you’re unable to code your own, which means that you have to use what is given.
*Ethereum* ( ) : Ethereum is a public blockchain platform. This platform is the most advanced for coding and processing smart contracts and you can code whatever you wish with it. It is important to note that you would have to pay for compute power with “ETH” tokens.
The potential for smart contracts to alter aspects of society is of significant magnitude and this is something that would provide a technical basis for all sorts of social changes. I find that extremely exciting.

https://cryptoclarified.com/2017/11/25/new-recommendation-add-lisk-to-the-watchlist-as-coin-with-possible-huge-upside/

Since the word ‘cryptocurrency’ first entered our vocabulary, no one expected a flood of other cryptocurrencies to enter the market, one after another, within a short time frame. Without exaggerating, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there. Tough competition, that’s for sure.
As a result, many altcoins end up ‘dead’ (defined as no reported market cap). According to CoinDesk’s State of Bitcoin and Blockchain report 2015 ( ) , there are over 400 ‘dead’ altcoins so far.
That being said, some altcoins have managed to persevere and capture some of the cryptocurrency market share. On closer look, one can see why – it is no longer enough for cryptocurrencies to simply be mere cryptocurrencies. The target audience – which includes computer programmers and IT experts ( ) – will only give second considerations to outstanding altcoins that deserve their attention.
Case in point – Ethereum ( ) , the second most popular network after Bitcoin (based on its market cap). This public blockchain platform can be used to execute peer-to-peer contracts using Ether, the cryptocurrency that is compatible with the Ethereum ( ) ecosystem.
The first of its kind, Lisk brands itself as the “first modular cryptocurrency utilising sidechains”. We’ll get to the sidechains part in a bit and focus on ‘modular’. As the name suggests, this coin involves ‘modules’ that serve as the basis of its design and construction.
The overall design is its trump card – the Lisk system allows anyone to use its ‘designing blocks’ to construct their own decentralised apps ( ). The language of choice for Lisk for individual app construction is Javascript, one of the most popular programming languages. Loads of programmers know Javascript, so we can say that the applicability value of Lisk is quite high.
By this point, we are all familiar with the blockchain, usually defined as public ledger of all completed transactions ( ). One problem that exists with blockchains is that it can be artificially bloated with test or fake transactions. When there are too many bad transactions, the ‘blocks’ get full faster and slow down the network (this is called ‘bloated’  network). No one likes a slow network.
Enter Lisk’s solution, the sidechain. Sidechains are additions to the main blockchain. Think of it like Post-It notes applied on book pages – you can add more value yet not clutter the main text. Sidechains can be attached to independent blockchains and serve as a place to put all the high-volume transactions without interfering with the main blockchain. As a result, this will ensure a fast network all day, every day (in theory). You can read more about sidechains in the whitepaper ( ) or Richard Brown’s simple explanation ( ).
On June 8 2016, Lisk CEO Max Kordek announced ( ) the addition of Charles Hoskinson (ex-CEO of Ethereum) and Steven Nerayoff (ex-advisor for Ethereum) as Senior Advisors of Lisk, to facilitate Product Development.
“There is no one else in the world like Charles who has the vision to build a successful cryptography project and Steven, who has an invaluable entrepreneur insight after founding six companies and being a venture capitalist.“
We briefly touched this in #1, but this deserves a special mention. Lisk wants to be the ‘de-facto standard for blockchain applications and services’, that are ‘standalone, decentralised, blockchain-based apps developed in Javascript’. Decentralised apps (‘dapps’) has great potential to be integrated into a wide variety of applications, including ‘immutable storage, a decentralized federation of hosting, oracle services, or computation of smart contracts.’ ( source for quotes ( ) )
“There is no public cryptocurrency platform which allows developers to easily deploy their own blockchain and build a JavaScript blockchain app on it… This will give millions of developers the ability to create their own sidechains, particularly around consumer applications, including games, social networks and the Internet of Things, but the same core functionality can also be used to develop and scale business applications.”
Basically, Lisk for programmers and developers is like easy-to-use WordPress templates for web designers. Instead of wasting time with complex coding languages, Lisk can be used to simplify the process of building, publishing, distributing and monetising applications without sacrificing quality.
From February to March 20116, Lisk crowdfunded ( ) 14,052 bitcoins, or about US$9.76 million (as of current bitcoin price at the time of writing). That is a lot of money. It was the fourth-highest crowdfund for any cryptocurrency, ever.
How does a decentralised app (again, ‘dapps’) look like? The potential of the Lisk network, with its modular cryptocurrency and utilising sidechains is what Lisk is trying to show. In its main page, Lisk showcases some examples: Criterion ( ) (Concept; Proof of Existence), Dust ( ) (Concept; Decentralised Trust on Lisk), Discovr ( ) (Concept; A social network for artists), MarketPlace ( ) (Prototype; A Decentralised Store on Lisk) and BlockData ( ) (Prototype; Smart Home on Lisk).
The developer community is a tight-knit community, so it’s little wonder that Lisk started a Country Ambassador ( ) initiative to promote the Lisk ecosystem and help provide technical support. So far, they have 11 country ambassadors who were cherry-picked (you can’t volunteer yourself) to act as community managers in their respective countries. According to this document ( ) which detailed responsibilities of ambassadors, they are not paid for this role (although bounties are available).
Last but not least, you should know about Lisk’s consensus model. Each LSK carries one vote, and only the top 101 users with the heaviest votes (ie highest number of Lisks individually owned) will be able to cast votes to carry forward motions and have a say in problem solving resolutions. You can learn more about the DPoS model here ( ).
Research-wise, Lisk has a higher ‘knowledge’ entry barrier for non-coders, so to fully understand and appreciate how it works, a background in programming won’t hurt. Like other altcoins, Lisk is also not immune to volatility. Since this cryptocurrency is very new, only time will tell if Lisk has what it takes to take off among mainstream Javascript coders, but there are certainly positive signals that they are heading in the right direction.

http://dailyfintech.com/2018/01/06/multi-layer-and-other-blockchain-scaling-solutions/

This is Part 10 in The Blockchain Economy book. This serialised book is a practical guidebook for investors, entrepreneurs and employees who want to learn how to prosper during the transition to an economy where value exchange is permissionless and disintermediated. For the index please go here ( ).
A blockchain based alternative should be 10x or 100x or more than what Visa can do today. We need massive scalability. That will enable totally new types of transaction such as Micropayments, real time payments and mobile money for the Unbanked. Linear scaling is not enough. It must be the kind of non-linear scaling that powered the Internet.
It is traditional to label these explainers “Dummies” or 101. We need a new label. The Daily Fintech community is super smart (no dummies among our subscribers), but they may not come from a technical background. We are in the translation business – from Tech to Biz and from Biz to Tech. Only when both Tech and Biz are working well together do good things happen.
Bitcoin Core says keep it to 1MB. Bitcoin Cash says grow the Block Size.This was the issue that created the Bitcoin Civil War. Should it stay at 1MB or should the Block Size grow to enable it to scale better? Tuning into a debate on this is like listening to Red State political shouting matches  – no civility, no listening, very little rationality.
Why : like an escrow service with notaries, essential for Smart Contracts where multiple entities need payment based on If This Then That type business logic and multiple signatures are needed before assets can be transferred.
Why: Rather than increase the size of each Bitcoin block, Segwit keeps signatures outside the Bitcoin block in order to save block space. Think of this like keeping signatures on a check outside the core transactional system (which only records that a signature was received and then points to the system where evidence of that signature is stored). This becomes more important now that MultiSig means more signatures.
Note 1: Segwit2x was created by a group allied to Bitcoin Cash that wants to  takeover the Bitcoin brand from Bitcoin Core. This groups  supports SegWit but wants a 2mb Block size – thus the Segwit2x moniker. The market will decide and that will depend largely on the success or failure of Lightning Network to enable multi-layer scalability.
Why/what : Privacy. Public transactions allow anyone to trace the flow of bitcoins over the blockchain and verifying a growing number of transactions adds to the cost of running a node. MimbleWimble builds on a Bitcoin Core feature called Confidential Transactions that lets senders encrypt the bitcoin amounts in transactions with random strings of numbers called “blinding factors.” This is decrypted by the receiver. Mimblewimble does the opposite as the the receiver generates the blinding factor.
Mimblewimble is similar in objective to CoinJoin, which scrambles all inputs and outputs, but goes a step further. Instead of transactions, MimbleWimble blocks mainly consist of three lists: a list of new inputs (referring to old outputs), a list of new outputs and a list of cryptographic signatures created with the aforementioned dummy output. Although primarily designed for privacy, MimbleWimble also enhances Scalability. Mimblewimble gets rid of the need to track transaction history per coin. One estimate is that if Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin had been used in Bitcoin from the start, nodes would currently require more than a terabyte of data. With MimbleWimble, they would need closer to 120 gigabytes. In short, if Bitcoin is to compete with more anonymous coins like Monero, something like MimbleWimble will be essential.
Why/what : When you want to send transactions from multiple addresses to one address, each of these transactions require their own signature, taking up more precious Block space. If it is just one person sending that transaction from multiple sources, Schnorr Signatures enables that to be done with just one signature. This is an incremental improvement, but a significant one. Some estimate that Schnorr signatures would reduce the use of storage and bandwidth by 25%. However a more important benefit might be increased privacy *.* Some users intentionally use multiple signatures to increase security using MultiSig. Schnorr signatures can hide that these signatures come from one person, increasing privacy. Schnorr Signatures also reduces spam attack risk – and the need is for scalability + security, so this is critical. As Bitcoin grows it comes under more attack.
* Bidirectional Payment Channels. Two participants create a ledger entry on the blockchain which requires both participants to sign off on any spending of funds. Both parties create transactions which refund the ledger entry to their individual allocation, but do not broadcast them to the blockchain. They can update their individual allocations for the ledger entry by creating many transactions spending from the current ledger entry output. Only the most recent version is valid, which is enforced by blockchain-parsable smart-contract scripting. This entry can be closed out at any time by either party without any trust or custodianship by broadcasting the most recent version to the blockchain. By creating a network of these two-party ledger entries, it is possible to find a path across the network similar to routing packets on the internet. The nodes along the path are not trusted, as the payment is enforced using a script which enforces the atomicity (either the entire payment succeeds or fails) via decrementing time-locks.
* Blockchain as Arbiter. As a result, it is possible to conduct transactions off-blockchain without limitations. Transactions can be made of-chain with confidence of onchain enforceability. This is similar to how one makes many legal contracts with others, but one does not go to court every time a contract is made. By making the transactions and scripts parsable, the smart-contract can be enforced on-blockchain. Only in the event of non-cooperation is the court involved – but with the blockchain, the result is deterministic (i.e there is as clear verdict)..
Who: as per Wikipedia – Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja wrote the Lightning white paper. The specification was announced after the paper. It is an open source specification (available on available on Github) with 3 companies developing competing but compatible solutions. These 3 companies are Blockstream, Lightning Labs  and ACINQ. The CEO of Lightning Labs is Elizabeth Stark and she is one of the most articulate spokesperson for Lightning Network. On a sidenote, it is good to see a woman running what is one of the most technically advanced projects in this space ( despite the rampant sexism in the tech biz ( ) ).
Note 2: This can enable a third layer of companies who build solutions on top of Lightning Network and Raiden. Today’s Blockchain Proof Of Work is Layer 1 aka Onchain processing. Layer 2 will be the commercial entities that use the open source Lightning Network code referenced above. Layer 3 will be companies offering services such as micropaments and streaming real time payments on top of Lightning Network or Raiden.
Why/what : functional scalability (as opposed to transaction scalability). The Bitcoin scripting language is minimalist (Turing-incomplete). This is unlike Ethereum where you can code whatever you like (Turing-complete). Sidechains allow a transaction to go Offchain, be processed in some way, and then returned to the main Bitcoin Blockchain.
The Internet looks like one of those systems that should not work in theory but works well in practice – meaning that the theory is wrong. Decentralized, loosely coupled systems are hard to understand but seem to work well. The Bitcoin Blockchain maybe the same. Which is why the future may lie with technology such as Lightning Network that enables a layered stack to develop.
Back in the dinosaur era, global banks processed cross border payments via central banks through a mechanism called Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). RTGS is how Central Banks settle among themselves – it is real time, but only Central Banks get access. It is fast, permissioned, big ticket. Think of that as Onchain processing. Then a payment gets into national payment systems and ledgers within banks get changed and Josephine Q. Public gets after Banks process messages via the SWIFT network. This national settlement is slow, semi-permissioned (any SWIFT Member can do it) and can be relatively small ticket (a few thousand dollars is OK). Think of RTGS as Offchain processing in the Legacy Finance world.
The Bitcoin world we are moving to today will look similar but better. Big transactions will be done Onchain, small transactions will be done Offchain (and settled Onchain in case of a dispute). Those who bemoan the centralisation that comes with Offchain processing need to chill. It’s like email. We all run our own email servers, but most of us choose not to do that. You can run your own mining rig and be the modern equivalent of a Central Bank – but most of us will choose not to do so.

https://sxi.io/what-if-one-bitcoin-isnt-like-the-others-fungibility-debated-at-scaling-conference.html

While bitcoin’s limited transaction capacity is no secret, day one of the ongoing Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan served to assert that there is perhaps another stage of development that needs to take place before the network is ready for increased volume.
Rather than focus on elements that have been given the most attention (most notably, the long-contentious block size ( ) ), day one opened with discussions focused on the economic concept of fungibility ( ) , or the idea that no one bitcoin should be able to be deemed less valuable or less legitimate as a result of its past use or ownership.
That bitcoin’s best value proposition is its ability to enable blockchain-secured data to be exchanged like cash was an argument put forth in the day’s first discussion, led by newly appointed Blockstream ( ) CEO Adam Back and Blockstream founder Matt Corallo.
Against other forms of digital money, Back inferred, fungibility is perhaps the greatest strength of bitcoin as a digital currency. Yet, he asserted that for-profit companies are threatening this attribute of the network by exploiting its current technological limitations.
Back contests that a lack of fungibility, if allowed to continue, could ultimately “leak” into the system, affecting bitcoin’s “permissionlessness”, or the ability of any parties to join and use the technology without censorship.
Other sessions on day one, held at Politecnico di Milano ( ) (and sponsored by companies including Deloitte, Blockstream and BTCC), sought to emphasize work in the open-source community aimed at addressing fungibility.
For example, talks were given on JoinMarket, a marketplace that links users of the transaction privacy method coinjoin ( ) ; Tumblebit ( ) , an anonymous, off-blockchain payment hub; and MimbleWimble, an unusual proposal ( ) that considers scalability improvements that could be achieved if bitcoin had an alternative blockchain design.
But if Back put forward the idea that fungibility is necessary should bitcoin want to become a more ubiquitous technology, attendees were apt to see the transition as a more direct effect of how businesses and regulators are forcing the issue.
“It’s becoming more of an issue with Coinbase and all the major onramps, there’s more know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) concerns,” Vorick told CoinDesk. “Things are moving in a direction where it seems like if your bitcoins have drug money associated with them, maybe startups are going to stop accepting them.”
Among attendees, there was a particular distrust of Coinbase ( ) , one of the ecosystem’s most high-profile startups over practices that they allege have seen potentially innocent bitcoin users blocked from the service.
Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop noted that discussion on fungibility is not exactly new, but that the sessions offered a more public spotlight for a long-standing frustration shared by developers.
Later workshops sought to categorize more than 10 available proposals for improving fungibility, with techniques including ring signatures ( ) , coinswap and the alternative blockchain Zcash ( ) seeing discussion.
Overall, the supporting talks aimed to highlight the specific strengths and weaknesses of different proposals mentioned in the fungibility workshop, while respecting that the larger goal of the community now is to focus on scaling the protocol.
For example, Bishop cited a proposal called Confidential Transactions (CT). Mentioned by Back in his talks as a poor way to offer privacy, Bishop agreed that the method is, in Back’s words, “terrible for scaling”.
Polestra, in his talk, highlighted how by reducing transactions to a combination “a list of block headers, a list of currently unspent outputs, and their range proofs”, each MimbleWimble-enabled transaction could be reduced to 100 bytes.
“Using MimbleWimble, we could get all the same privacy guarantees, with slightly different security assumptions, [and it would be] less than 5MB total for the entire blockchain history,” he explained.
Pavel Kravchenko, founder of Distributed Lab, a startup aiming to build blockchain products for the financial sector, noted he believes there is agreement that fungibility should matter to all end users, even those who might not use bitcoin’s currency.----




https://www.coinrise.ca/coinrisehow-does-tumblebit-compare-to-monero-and-zcash/

TumbleBit ( ) is one of the latest developments in the land of Bitcoin privacy proposals, and it’s gaining a large amount of attention from those who understand the importance of fungibility ( ) in digital cash systems. This privacy enhancement essentially allows a user to send transactions through a tumbler without the possibility of having their funds stolen or the tumbler learning about the connection between the sender and the receiver.
This improvement can be implemented without any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, which has some wondering how well Bitcoin will soon be able to compete against the more privacy-focused altcoins such as Monero ( ) and Zcash ( ).
Monero is a cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote protocol ( ). Ring signatures ( ) and stealth addresses ( ) are used to protect the privacy and anonymity of Monero users. The alternative cryptocurrency recently gained a bit of attention after it was integrated into a couple of darknet marketplaces ( ).
*“Monero is a separate blockchain from bitcoin, and it achieves its privacy by making spends ambiguous as to what coins are actually being spent,” explained Poelstra. “This requires that people be running Monero and using Monero coins to use this and that everyone using the system has to validate the blockchain, which grows much faster than say Bitcoin because of its scaling features.”*
When ask for his thoughts on TumbleBit, Spagni told CoinJournal , “Principally it seems fine, but practically it’s no better than a tumbler — if the tumbler was magically not going to steal your funds or leak metadata.”
*“Privacy is useless unless it’s enforced in the protocol,” Spagni added. “ Dash ( ) is an excellent example. There is so little usage of the privacy stuff that they’ve had to use their MasterNode budget to pay ‘liquidity providers’ to provide mixing liquidity. And if there happens to be tons of mixing liquidity, great, but how much of the mixing liquidity is untainted and not Sybil attacked ( ) ?”*
Poelstra explained that the need for a central server prevents TumbleBit from being implemented at the protocol level. “[Servers] are a single point of failure. They can be ephemeral and no funds are at risk, so it’s not a problem, but it makes it hard to integrate with a blockchain, which is forever.”
Implementing anonymization and privacy features in a cryptocurrency at the base protocol level, like Monero does, is generally better because it means everyone a user mixes their transactions with is mixing all of their other transactions as well.
Zcash is the culmination of many years of work on the creation of a truly anonymous digital cash system. Based on the work in the Zerocoin ( ) and Zerocash ( ) white papers, Zcash is described as following in the company’s FAQ ( ) :
*“Zcash is an open source, decentralized cryptocurrency, with system-wide privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensures the maximum possible privacy for transactions conducted within the network.”*
When buying Zcash ( ) , it is said to provide the highest level of anonymity possible when compared to other systems, but there are also some drawbacks ( ). “The privacy from Zcash would be a bit stronger because your anonymity set is all coins in the system vs TumbleBit, where it’s all coins in this round [of mixing],” said Poelstra. “But Zcash is much, much slower, it requires new crypto assumptions, and it’s still got that trusted setup. Though, my understanding is the Zcash folks have a tractable way to do the trusted setup in a multiparty way.”
When asked for his opinion on the matter, Zcash Advisor Andrew Miller ( ) agreed with the tradeoffs mentioned by Poelstra. “Zcash still has the advantage of a larger anonymity set after only one transaction,” said Miller. “You might also compare Bolt ( ) with TumbleBit in ‘lightning network’ mode. It’s cool that TumbleBit supports that. Bolt is like a lightning network channel for Zcash, the privacy is better here too, but I think it requires a modification to Zcash relative to the 1.0 plans.”
*“This gets to an essential question in blockchain design: What is the correct balance between building the features we want into the blockchain itself but increasing the complexity of consensus critical code or keeping the consensus critical code simple by building those features into the payment channel network layer instead?”*
Privacy is an essential aspect of any currency to maintain fungibility, and there will undoubtedly be many more privacy improvement proposals that alter what’s possible with digital cash systems in the future — including Monero and Zcash sidechains ( ) , which would essentially allow users to access to the features of those blockchains without the need to create a new altcoin (bitcoin would be used).
Miller was able to sum up the general feeling of those who are working on improving privacy in cryptocurrencies when he said, “Overall, I’m mostly just excited that there’s so much activity in this space now. I like Monero and CoinShuffle a lot too.”
RISK DISCLOSURE:  recognizes that trading Crypto currencies can generate profits, but it can also carry a high level of risk. It is therefore not suitable for all investors. Traders are recommended to enter the markets with a money management system as well as take expert advice in order to avoid incurring losses and protect their investment.----




https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/zcash-ceo-zooko-discusses-privacy-and-efficiency-tradeoffs-vs-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1458829054

Zcash ( ) , which is an implementation of the zerocash ( ) concept, is often referred to as the first form of truly anonymous digital cash. While Bitcoin been called a haven for criminals by many misinformed individuals, the reality is Satoshi Nakamoto ( ) ’s creation is a mostly-transparent ledger.
Although Zcash enables the highest level of privacy currently allowed by cryptography, there are still some potential issues (mostly unrelated to privacy) for the financial-anonymity protocol to overcome. Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn ( ) recently discussed some of these issues on Epicenter Bitcoin ( ).
The main issue with Zcash right now is that generating a new privacy-preserving spend is somewhat inefficient. Zooko, as he is commonly known, explained this issue during his recent Epicenter Bitcoin appearance:
Zooko also added that privacy-preserving spend generation likely requires more than 4 gigabytes of RAM, although he also mentioned that they don’t have precise measurements on RAM requirements quite yet.
With the current version of Zcash, there are definitely efficiency and usability tradeoffs. Having said that, this system is also intended to give users the highest level of financial anonymity and privacy.
Although Zcash’s privacy-preserving transactions are somewhat inefficient, the digital currency’s users also have the ability to make traditional, transparent transactions, which are similar to Bitcoin transactions. Zooko explained that using a hybrid of privacy-preserving and transparent transactions on the Zcash blockchain can still offer many advantages over a traditional Bitcoin transaction.
“There’s a bunch of functionality in the Bitcoin ‒ or the globally transparent protocol ‒ that we can’t do with a privacy-preserving spend ‒ like multisignature transactions ( ). Those are really important in Bitcoin. There’s a lot of really cool things being built with multisignature transactions.”
Although there are still some issues with the Zcash protocol, it’s clear that the availability of a truly anonymous cash system is desired by the vast majority of the digital currency community. This sort of cryptographically-ensured privacy should become more usable over time. Perhaps the currently-available testnet version of Zcash ( ) should be viewed as an early preview of what’s to come in the future of privacy-conscious digital currencies.

*How will the world’s gradual economic migration into Bitcoin take place? As the Bitcoin platform allows for boundless new technology applications, and as technology can solve innumerable problems for mankind, there will be an infinite number of applications eventually created by Bitcoin. Just as the Internet continues to evolve through the introduction of email, the world wide web, instant messaging, social media, peer-to-peer file sharing (and now peer-to-peer money), Bitcoin itself will iterate and evolve to encompass more possible avenues of value than its initial design allowed. New applications will be layered over the blockchain to securely create digital escrow, digital stock issuance, digital land registry, and more. These are the macroscopic trends; it is equally interesting to see what could happen on the microscopic level.*
The emergence of such technologies as virtualization and cloud computing, for instance, proves that “untrustworthy” or unrealistic technological feats become industry-norms all the time. It’s not uncommon now ( ) to hear large companies ( ) are almost fully virtualized – or, indeed, that they’ve migrated their whole data center to the cloud. While the proper and optimal degree of utilization for some companies will certainly differ with respect to their needs, companies like VMWare and Windstream are definitely main players in the IT landscape. The technologies they earn billions of dollars supporting only became popular in the last decade or so. It would not be surprising if some large, established security company like Kaspersky or Sophos or Symantec or Trend Micro started researching, building, and marketing hardware and software products to protect end user Bitcoin balances. Perhaps SatoshiLabs (the makers of Trezor) will grow to join the ranks of these companies as a security giant.
Thus, the players in competitive markets will hurriedly advance the growth of Bitcoin and blockchain-based technology, as every business stands to gain from successful implementation. As businesses compete and strive with each other, business practices will be emulated and improved. With the exciting advent of 802.11ax WiFi standard ( ) and next-gen SSDs ( ) , the Internet of Things ( ) (IoT) is becoming painted more and more into reality. Devices will be able to communicate with each other regarding energy use, uptime, instruction sets, and more. Wireless access points from Aruba ( ) can already operate in a decentralized, controller-less manner, where every access point retains a full set of independently-deployable instructions regarding channel selection, radio frequency, SSID and subnet configurations, etc. and shares them with other nodes to route network traffic efficiently.
With Bitcoin technology, it is not implausible to imagine a world where these devices and others can automatically sign transactions to each other in order to distribute costs for energy usage, or to rent out capacity in dynamic, high-volume situations. The game-theoretic implications are, like with most technology, that rational actors will desire to maintain a comparative advantage over their competitors, and they will employ more and more advanced technology as a means to 1) reduce costs and thereby reduce prices, and 2) introduce new, formerly uneconomical, features as an entrepreneurial gambit to gain market share. Bitcoin satisfies these reasons in spades
Bitcoin wallets can take any number of forms. They can be backed-up physically in paper wallets and guarded with conventional physical security measures. They can remain software on a server, should a company decide to use a wallet like Armory to secure their funds. Lightweight wallets might be offered as a subscription basis in a cloud solution. They could even be browser wallets, where the web browser retains the private key and transaction details client-side, as with KryptoKit. This flexibility allows for a host of devices to be equipped with Bitcoin wallet features, including phone systems, printers, mobile devices, switches, servers, routers, desktop computers, storage devices, etc.
Beyond this, even the identity and wealth of a firm could be represented using blockchain technology. Shares of company stock could be represented as colored coins on the Bitcoin network (or by releasing a new coin on an alternate blockchain) and could be traded effortlessly between individuals and institutions. Crypto-equity is the name given to the parallel emergence of an immutable stock market, represented by cryptographically protected and authenticated digital assets. Patrick Byrne of Overstock, in fact, has partnered with developers from Counterparty ( ) to build a digital, decentralized stock exchange called Medici ( ) , which he hopes will compete and succeed over physical stock exchanges such as the NYSE. Finally, blockchain entries can serve as authentication tokens for employees with security clearance. By control of certain Bitcoin keypairs, one could demonstrate their identity ( ) without reference to a legal environment.
In all these ways and more, the gradual materialization of Bitcoin technology in the IT environments of small and large companies will change the face of business forever. Just as double-entry bookkeeping gave firms a better understanding of their accounting and enabled the rise of Renaissance banking, so too will the adoption of Bitcoin technology enable the rise of mass crowdfunding capabilities, micropayments, “as a service” cloud offerings, and the creation of decentralized, autonomous organizations. Bitcoin-capable vending machines will be able to purchase supplies and order repairs on their own; servers and personal computers will be able to purchase bandwidth from the routers and access points. This will lead to greater device efficiency and ultimately a massive reduction in human effort needed to maintain business operations and continuity. Blockchains allow for devices to spend and receive money autonomously and delegating such tasks “to the edge” frees human involvement, which can be used in any number of higher-priority projects. Combined with an advanced network monitoring tool like Paessler’s PRTG ( ) where data is collected from hundreds of sensors all throughout the technology environment, even entry-level network administrators could reliably watch over the given financial programming. Rules could be established where certain classes of devices spend X amount of bitcoin hourly, and only in such and such cases, do these other classes outspend them to the tune of Y, which might represent a signal to the administrative team to investigate the error. Whether it is a bandwidth clog, temperature differential, power outage, compression delay, or a backed-up printer, metrics gathered by resource use (bitcoin spend) would immediately give administrators information needed to resolve the issue.----

*Share* ( ) ( Are Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology? – CaptainAltcoin&url=https%3A%2F%2Fflizzyy.com%2F%3Fp%3D87908 ) ( ) ( Are Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology? – CaptainAltcoin ) ( Are Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology? – CaptainAltcoin %0A%0A https%3A%2F%2Fflizzyy.com%2F%3Fp%3D87908 ) ( Are Smart Contracts in Blockchain Technology? – CaptainAltcoin ) ( )
The *blockchain* ( ) is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties. One of the best things about the blockchain is that there’s no need to pay intermediaries (Middle men) and it saves you time and conflict. Blockchains have their problems. However, they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems. These are the reasons why banks and governments are turning to them. We can make business more efficient and make the legal system more equitable by giving computers control over contracts.
Imagine if you could make it easier to update your will, cut your mortgage rate, or ensure that your buddy was never able to weasel out of paying up on a bet? That and much more is the promise of smart contracts. Thanks to cryptocurrency smart contracts are a technology that is getting closer and closer to reality.
However, major questions abound as always with this cutting edge of financial technology: Will anyone actually use these things anyway? And, of course, how will this all align with our current legal system?
The idea of smart contracts goes way back to 1994. That’s when *Nick Szabo* ( ) , a cryptographer widely credited with laying the groundwork for bitcoin, realized that the decentralized ledger could be used for smart contracts, otherwise called self-executing contracts, blockchain contracts, or digital contracts. In this format, contracts could be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain and this would also result in ledger feedback such as receiving the product or service and transferring money.
Szabo’s original theories about how these contracts could work remained unrealized. The reason for this is that there was no digitally native financial system that could support programmable transactions. (If a bank still has to manually authorize the release and transfer of money the purpose of smart contracts is defeated). Phil Rapoport, Ripple Labs’ director of markets and trading says: “One big hurdle to smart contracts is that computer programs can’t really trigger payments right now.”
The advent and increasingly widespread adoption of bitcoin is changing that. As a result Szabo’s idea has seen a revival and smart contract technology is now being built on top of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
Smart contracts help you exchange money, shares, property, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way. The best thing is that smart contracts allow you avoid the services of a middleman.
Comparing the smart contracts to a vending machine is the best way to describe the technology. Usually, if you need some document you would go to a notary or a lawyer, pay them, and wait until you get the document. With smart contracts, on the other hand, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your driver’s license, escrow, or whatever drops into your account. This means that smart contracts define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does. This technology also automatically enforces those obligations.
Codius was developed by Ripple Labs. This company also created its own digital currency called Ripple. Although Codius is managed by the private company, it aims to be interoperable between a variety of cryptocurrency, such as Ripple and bitcoin.
Ethereum is originally developed by 20-year-old programmer Vitalik Buterin. It is an entirely new currency with smart contracts baked into its payment system and it would replace other “coins” like bitcoin, but appears to be more of a community project.
Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are poised to help smart contracts become reality, but the effect may also be reciprocal. Smart contracts can illustrate a unique benefit of virtual currencies that some lawyers think could attract more people.
Smart contracts can be used for all sorts of situations that range from credit enforcement to financial services, financial derivatives, insurance premiums, legal processes, crowd funding agreements, breach contracts and property law.
Here is the code for a basic smart contract. It was written on the Ethereum blockchain. Contracts can be encoded on any blockchain. However, Ethereum gives unlimited processing capability so it is mostly used.
Let’s take a simple example, like the NBA Finals bet. Say you want to bet $500–or roughly one bitcoin–that the Cavs will win. On the other hand, your friend is betting the same amount that the Warriors will take the title. Your friend and you should place your bitcoin in a neutral account controlled by the smart contract. The smart contract would automatically deposit your bet and your winnings from your friend back into your account when the game is over and the smart contract is able to verify via ESPN, CNN, or elsewhere that the Warriors beat the Cavs.
Smart contracts are computer programs. That’s why it would be trivial to add more complex betting elements like odds and score differentials into the mix. There are services out there today that might handle this sort of transaction. However, they all charge a fee. The key difference with smart contracts is that it doesn’t require any intermediary party because it is a decentralized system accessible to anyone.
Online shopping would be a more everyday example. You might not want to pay a merchant immediately if you order something online. You will pay them when they fulfil their end of the bargain. Before releasing payment to the sender, you could easily have a contract that looks for FedEx tracking data saying that the package you ordered has been delivered to your address.
Because of its accuracy, transparency, and automated system the blockchain not only provides a single ledger as source of trust, but also shaves possible snarls in communication and workflow. Usually, while waiting for approvals and for internal or external issues to sort themselves out, business operations have to endure a back-and forth. A blockchain ledger streamlines this and it also cuts out discrepancies that typically occur with independent processing. This may lead to costly lawsuits and settlement delays.
Insiders vouch that it is extremely difficult for our voting system to be rigged. However, smart contracts would allay all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Ledger-protected votes would need to be decoded and require excessive computing power to access but no one has that much computing power. Furthermore, smart contracts could hike low voter turnout. Much of the inertia comes from a fumbling system. This includes lining up, showing your identity, and completing forms. Volunteers can transfer voting online with smart contracts and millennials will turn out en masse to vote for their Potus.
“UPS can execute contracts that say, ‘If I receive cash on delivery at this location in a developing, emerging market, then this other [product], many, many links up the supply chain, will trigger a supplier creating a new item since the existing item was just delivered in that developing market.’” All too often, paper-based systems hamper supply chains. Here forms have to pass through numerous channels for approval and this increases exposure to loss and fraud. The blockchain provides a secure, accessible digital version to all parties on the chain to nullify this and automates tasks and payment.
Smart contracts can get you more money. Normally, you’d need to pay a middleman such as Craigslist or a newspaper to advertise if you wanted to rent your apartment to someone. You would also need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The ledger cuts the costs. All you do is pay via bitcoin and encode your contract on the ledger, everyone sees, and you accomplish automatic fulfilment. Anyone associated with the property game, like brokers, real estate agents, hard money lenders can profit.
We’re progressing from slothful pre-human vertebrates to super-smart robots and there is no doubt about it. Imagine a future where everything is automated and that’s where smart contracts help. The self-autonomous or self-parking vehicles are one example. Here, smart contracts could put into play a sort of ‘oracle’, the sensor or the driver, as well as countless other variables, that could detect who was at fault in a crash. An automobile insurance company could charge rates differently using smart contracts, based on where, and under which, conditions users are operating their vehicles.
Using a private key which would grant access only to specific individuals, personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted via HIPAA laws (in a secure and confidential way), which means that receipts of surgeries could be stored on a blockchain and automatically sent to insurance providers as proof-of-delivery. You can also use the ledger for general health care management, such as managing healthcare supplies, supervising drugs, regulation compliance, and testing results.
If you think about a lot of routine financial transactions, what lawyers and banks do boils down to repetitively processing mundane tasks and yet we still have to shell out huge fees for banks to process our mortgage payments or for lawyers to go through wills.
When you need mortgage you get it through a bank. However, that bank won’t generally hold onto your mortgage for the entire 30-year loan and your mortgage will be sold to an investor. But you don’t make payments to the investor that owns your mortgage. You keep making payments to the bank and the bank just becomes a processor for your monthly payments. The bank will send a slice to taxes, a chunk to the investor, and a bit for homeowner’s insurance.
“That’s just a real simple operational task. However, to service that mortgage, that bank will often take a quarter to a half percent per year, “says Rapoport. “They’re just doing an operational headache of receiving payments and redirecting them and they’re charging you for that. But it’s something that could theoretically be administered very easily with a smart contract. “
Mortgage processing fees could be eliminated and that savings passed on to consumers if mortgage payments were handled by smart contracts. The result would be a lowered cost of home ownership, which would be great for most people.
Smart contracts have clear potential, although they are still in their nascent stage. If a simple enough user interface were developed it could remove a host of legal headaches. For example, this can help you with updating your will. Imagine if allocating your assets after you die was as simple as moving an adjustable slider that determines who gets what. Just like with the bet or FedEx example, the contract goes into effect and your assets are divvied up once the smart contract can verify the triggering condition–in this case, your death.
Nonetheless, lawyers might have very different role in the future. The role of lawyers might shift to producing smart contract templates on a competitive market rather than having lawyers adjudicate individual contracts. Contract selling points would be their quality, their ease of use, and how customizable they are.
It’s easy to think about a smart contract managing a will and if you can imagine yourself keeping all of your assets in bitcoin it all makes sense. But what if you live in the real world and have physical possessions? The answer is something that we call smart property.
Ellis explained that this started to get more sci-fi when we talk about smart property. The so-called “Internet of Things” is constantly growing. It has more and more interconnected devices out there every day and some forward-thinking developers *are already working on* ( ) ways to combine the Internet of Things with bitcoin infrastructure. They want that something like a bitcoin can actually represent a physical object and that token is what these developers call smart property.
These new smart property tokens would actually grant ownership and control to a networked object, whether that be a computer, a car, or even a house. This is more important than representing some object.
Ellis gives the example of renting out his house: “Let’s say all the locks have got network connections, and they are all Internet-enabled. The smart contract you and I agreed to automatically unlocks the house for you when you make a bitcoin transaction for the rent and you just go in using keys stored on your Smartphone.”
Doing the same sublet with a smart contract would supplant Airbnb’s. The homeowner and renter just need to trust the smart contract and they still don’t need to trust each other. Smart contracts would decentralize the model of who needs to be trusted, which would cut out hefty fees by brokering services like Airbnb.
Smart contracts don’t have to just disrupt existing business models, they can also complement them. Nick Szabo envisioned the idea of smart property writing way back in his ’94 essay. He said that “smart property might be created by embedding smart contracts in physical objects.” His example of choice was a car loan. He said that the smart contract could automatically revoke your digital keys to operate the car if you miss a car payment. Car dealerships would definitely find this appealing.
*Autonomy* – You’re the one making the agreement. This means that there’s no need to rely on a lawyer, broker, or other intermediaries to confirm. Incidentally, since execution is managed automatically by the network, rather than by one or more, possibly biased, individuals who may err, this also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party.
*Speed* – To manually process documents, you’d ordinarily have to spend chunks of time and paperwork. Smart contracts use software code to automate tasks. This feature shaves hours off a range of business processes.
*Safety* – Cryptography, the encryption of websites, keeps your documents safe, which means that there is no hacking. In fact, to crack the code and infiltrate it would take an abnormally smart hacker.
Admittedly, it does start to sound like the makings of a dystopian sci-fi film at some point. Your car could be digitally and remotely repossessed if you can’t make a payment. This would be done without any human interaction.
Ellis said that at present justice really only works if you have enough money to hire a lawyer to enforce that agreement. So it will be game-changing once smart contracts have the ability to enforce agreements on their own.
Rapoport admitted that there may be drawbacks and he said that in some ways it’s easier to read a traditional contract because everyone reads in English. But this is still very bleeding-edge technology. This means that we don’t know what kinds of user-facing improvements will be made eventually.
Smart contracts are far from perfect and there is a lot to be learned about them. How should these contracts be regulated by governments? What if bugs get in the code? How would these smart contract transactions be taxed by governments? Remember my rental situation as a case in point.
What happens if I send the wrong code? Or, as lawyer *Bill Marino points out* ( ) , I send the right code, but my apartment is condemned before the rental date arrives? I could rescind it in court if this were the traditional contract. However, the blockchain is a different situation and the contract performs, no matter what.
Part of the future of smart contracts lies in entangling these problems. For example, in Cornell Tech ( ) there are some lawyers who insist that smart contracts will enter our everyday life. They have dedicated themselves to researching these concerns.
Actually, we’re stepping into a sci-fi screen when it comes to smart contracts. The IT resource center, Search Compliance *suggests* that smart contracts may impact changes in certain industries, such as law and lawyers will transfer from writing traditional contracts to producing standardized smart contract templates in that case. These templates are similar to the standardized traditional contracts that you’ll find on *LegalZoom* ( ). Other industries, like credit companies, merchant acquirers, and accountants may also employ smart contracts for tasks. They can employ them as real time auditing and risk assessments. In fact, the website Blockchain Technologies *sees* smart contracts merging into a hybrid of paper and digital content. Here contracts are verified via blockchain and substantiated by physical copy.
*NXT* ( ) : NXT is a public blockchain platform. It contains a limited selection of templates for smart contracts. It is important to note that you’re unable to code your own, which means that you have to use what is given.
*Ethereum* ( ) : Ethereum is a public blockchain platform. This platform is the most advanced for coding and processing smart contracts and you can code whatever you wish with it. It is important to note that you would have to pay for compute power with “ETH” tokens.
The potential for smart contracts to alter aspects of society is of significant magnitude and this is something that would provide a technical basis for all sorts of social changes. I find that extremely exciting.

On blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts are a piece of code running on top of the blockchain protocols that where the rules of a transaction are embedded into the code and automatically enforced once all parties to the smart contract meet the pre-defined rules. Smart contracts can radically reduce transaction costs of reaching an agreement, formalization, and enforcement of relationships between people, institutions and the assets they own, by standardizing transaction rules. The transaction rulesets (agreement) of the smart contract define the conditions – rights and obligations – to which parties to a smart contract consent. They are often predefined, and agreement is reached by simple opt-in actions. They are formalized in digital form, in machine-readable code (formalization). These rights and obligations established in the smart contract can now be automatically executed by a computer or a network of computers as soon as the parties have come to an agreement and met the conditions of the agreement (enforcement). This auto enforceable code of the blockchain layer, as well as the smart contract layer, radically reduces transaction costs, replacing traditional middle men with machine consensus.

http://tech.cornell.edu/news/smart-contracts-the-next-big-blockchain-application

Blockchain is in the news again, recently landing a cover story in The Economist ( ). This time, the focus of the conversation is applications of the blockchain beyond the one you already know: cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin.
One of these new applications is cryptocontracts — i.e., smart contracts. While the Economist article mentions them only fleetingly, smart contracts are the blockchain use case most likely to appear in your daily life soon.
A smart contract is a contract captured in software that automatically performs the obligations the parties have committed to under their agreement. It turns out the ideal place to store such a contract, both because of its immutability and its cryptographic security, is a blockchain. Many blockchain-based smart contracts currently being engineered are complex, covering everything from financial derivatives to crowd funding agreements ( ). But there are relatable ones, too.
Here’s an example. Suppose you want to rent my apartment for a night. It would be easy to craft our rental agreement as a smart contract. In fact, it can have just two functions. First, to accept transmission of a rental fee (in cryptocurrency form, let’s say) from you, the renter. It will send me a receipt but hold the fee in the contract. Second, to accept transmission of a digital apartment entry key from me.
If I send the key before the rental date, the function holds it, along with the fee, releasing them to you and me, respectively, when the date arrives. If the function does not receive my key by the rental date, it refunds you the fee.
Once we initialize the contract, we can relax, knowing that our agreement will be programmatically enforced. If I send a key, I’m sure to be paid. If you send a fee, you’re sure to receive a key (or a refund).
And this is just one of many interesting legal conundrums surrounding smart contracts. How will courts intervene when contracts violate securities or other laws? If they exist on the blockchain, who will have jurisdiction? Who can tax them? The list goes on.
As a lawyer and Computer Science master’s student at Cornell Tech, I was long captivated by smart contracts and eager to probe these issues. In that regard, Cornell Tech has been a serendipitous fit because it’s leading the effort to study smart contracts. In fact, three of our faculty members — Ari Juels, Roni Michaely, and Rafael Pass — are part of the Initiative For Cryptocurrencies & Contracts ( ) (IC3), several of whose faculty were the recent recipients ( ) of a $3 million NSF grant to study this field.
This fall, I have been fortunate enough to do research for IC3 and Professor Juels, examining some of the very issues discussed above. I will present some of my findings in December during a smart contract tutorial at JURIX 2015 ( ) , the 28th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems.
In November, I had a chance to do the same at Ethereum DevCon1 ( ) , the first large developer’s conference for Ethereum, a premier blockchain-based smart contract platform. In addition to my presentation, DevCon1 featured talks by Nick Szabo, often credited with first conceiving of smart contracts, and singer Imogen Heap, who is building a music distribution contract on Ethereum.----




http://laurentmt.blogspot.fr/2014/03/about-nature-of-cryptocurrencies.html

A few days ago, Richard Gendal Brown published an interesting post ( ) describing Bitcoin as a land territory. There is some very good points in this article (importance of UTXO, ...) and it's great because like many things in Bitcoin, it invites you to think about the nature of money, cryptocurrencies... But I must confess that I feel a bit unconfortable with this metaphor, mainly because of its implications about the fungibility of bitcoins.
Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. It's often said that cash is fungible, i.e. a 10$ bank note is interchangeable with another. Diamonds are not perfectly fungible because diamonds' varying cuts, colors, grades, and sizes make it difficult to find many diamonds with the same cut, color, grade, and size (more here ( ) ).
One of Richard's axiom is that bitcoins are not perfectly fungible : they're more similar to diamonds (and others physical objects like lands) than to dollars. This is where I start to feel unconfortable with the metaphor of the land.
Trying to figure what are the core concepts of Bitcoin, I noticed there's a common mistake made about the nature of bitcoins. We like to imagine bitcoins as objects (properties): it's in the name (bitCOINS), it's in the visual imaginary...
It's sometime the cause of "funny" situations like TSA looking for bitCOINS inside luggages ( ). The problem is there's nothing in Bitcoin protocol like an object (property) which we could call a bitCOIN. Bitcoin protocol is all about flows.
* The "thing" flowing in this system is not a kind of object (bitCOIN, satoshis,...) but is trusted ownership. Trusted ownership is not a object transmitted from one address to another. It's a continuous flow going from the sources to the latest UTXO.
* If you "cut" the flow (basically what happens when a of the blockchain occurs with double spendings ( ) ) the valves victim of double spending don't receive the flow anymore. The flow of trusted ownership going from the sources to these valves is broken and there's no more liquid reaching these valves : the coins have gone ! (TM MTGox)
My take is that the metaphor used has a direct incidence about how we think about the cryptocurrencies systems and how they can be regulated (or not). IRS says bitcoin is property ( ). IRS is not alone and it's often said that bitcoins are less fungible than cash.
The problem is that technically speaking it's wrong. We consider that a bank note is interchangeable with another even if bank notes are physical objects with serial numbers. Thus, saying that bitcoins are less fungible than dollars is like saying that water is less liquid than pebbles.
IRS can consider that bitcoins are properties but it's conceptually wrong and this mistake will be more and more problematic for them in the future. For now, transactions are most of the time issued by one person and that's why the metaphor of the land (or bitcoins considered as properties) seems ok. But nothing in Bitcoin protocol restricts the system to this scheme and mixers are a good example of a different scheme which breaks the metaphor of the property.
According to the future decisions made by regulators Bitcoin could become a system of properties but it would be a distortion of the true nature of the protocol. As pointed out by Richard : "it is perhaps no surprise that the fungibility issue is so hot right now."----




https://blog.steliosrammos.com/2020/04/14/what-is-bitcoin-mining-and-how-does-it-actually-work/

Bitcoin mining refers to the security mechanism implemented into the Bitcoin protocol to achieve consensus over the state of the blockchain, in a decentralised way. It is key to understand how that mechanism prevents someone from  cheating the system, thereby making the network not only more secure, but antifragile too.
It can be hard to wrap your head around Bitcoin, both on a conceptual and on a technological level. It is unique in many ways and its use cases might not seem clear at first. For that reason, the Bitcoin community and the media came up with many analogies to make it easier for less tech savvy people to visualize what Bitcoin is. One such analogy you might have heard of is the famous digital gold narrative. This analogy appeared relatively early in Bitcoin’s history, partly to justify its existence and partly to relate it to something people knew and understood. As such, the most early adopters started using the term *bitcoin mining* to draw a parallel with gold mining.
The goal of this article will be to help you understand how bitcoin mining actually works. We will explain what terms like *Proof Of Work* (or *POW* ), *cryptographic puzzle* and *hash functions* mean and how they all come together under the popular term ‘bitcoin mining’. The difference between a transaction *validation* and a transaction *confirmation* will also be explained. Technical words will be highlighted in bold and explained throughout the article and you will also find below an infographic of the whole process.
Bitcoin mining essentially consists of solving (or attempting to solve) a simple *cryptographic puzzle* , which when solved, proves *mathematically* that a set of bitcoin transactions are valid. You can think of this cryptographic puzzle as trying to find the code of a lock. There are no shortcuts possible when trying to find the code which unlocks it. You have to try every possible combination, until at some point, you find the correct one by chance. I like this analogy because it describes well the characteristics of the cryptographic puzzle used by Bitcoin. Just like trying to find the combination that unlocks the lock, trying to find the correct solution to the puzzle is very time and energy consuming. Further, just as it is extremely easy and quick to check that a lock combination is the correct one (it either unlocks or doesn’t), it is extremely easy and quick for the miner, and for other miners after, to check that the solution proposed to the bitcoin puzzle is indeed the right one.
This process of attempting several solutions until encountering the correct one is called *Proof of Work* (or *POW* ) and the cryptographic puzzle (or *POW algorithm* ) in the Bitcoin protocol uses *SHA256 ,* which stands for “ Secure Hash Algorithm ”. Since miners expand so much time and energy to solve this puzzle and thus validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, the protocol rewards them for their effort with:
When a miner validates the transactions, they are bundled in a block and added to the Bitcoin blockchain. And for every new block that gets added to the blockchain, new bitcoins are created according to the issuance rate determined by the protocol at the time of the block creation. At the time of writing, new issuance is 12.5 BTC per block and is expected to halve around May 2020.
When people transact with bitcoin, they pay a fee to the miners to incentivise him further to validate their transaction. Thus, when a miner validates a set of transactions, he also collects all the fees paid for that set of transactions. As of now, this represents a very small percentage of the total mining reward, but as the issuance rate decreases, the fees will become a more significant source of income for miners.
Simply put, a hash is a string of characters. This string of characters is the output of a special function called a *hashing function*. Hash functions are special because they can take any (literally any) series of digital data (a text file, a video, a picture, a song anything) as input and transform it into a single string of characters. What makes this function even more special (and more interesting in our use case), is that if you change even one character in the input (or one byte really), the output string, or *hash* , will be *completely* different with no link whatsoever to the previous output.
At this point it might still seem unclear how SHA256 works and how it helps miners reach consensus on the state of the blockchain. To understand this, it is important to recall what information is included in Bitcoin blocks, or most importantly, how transactions are included in Bitcoin blocks. Most information contained in a Bitcoin block on the blockchain is represented by a hash and every block itself is tied to a unique hash. Let’s list some of the essential elements which are combined to generate a Bitcoin block hash:
The hash of the list of all transaction hashes included in the block. A transaction hash is created by combining the following elements into a single hash: the sender’s hash, the receiver’s hash and the amount sent (ie: the UTXO’s, read more about them here ( ) ).
The nonce is the key to the puzzle. It is a positive integer number, which when combined with the previous two elements (transactions hash + previous block’s hash), creates the final block’s hash (see Figure 1).
In *SHA256* , the condition which needs to be met to ensure the correct nonce was found, is that the block’s hash should start with a series of zeros. That is, when we input into the hashing function: the transactions’ hash, the previous block’s hash and the nonce, the output hash should start with a series of zeros. The way the hashing function works ensures that there is only one possible solution (ie: only one nonce which leads to such a hash). In the same way there is only one combination that unlocks the lock in our previous analogy.
So the nonce is the key to the cryptographic puzzle, but what really makes this a beautiful and secure algorithm is the fact that it requires the hash of the previous block as an input to find the solution. It is one of the *three key elements* composing the final block hash. Recall that the property of a hashing function is that any change in the input completely changes the output with no deterministic link to the previous output. Therefore, even a slight change in any of the inputs (say a change of amount sent in one of the transactions) changes the final hash and invalidates the nonce.
To understand how the algorithm introduces *security* and truly *validates* the transaction set in the block, let’s go over a simple example. Imagine the situation where Alice sends Bob 1 BTC. After signing this transaction with her private key, Alice’s bitcoin wallet ( ) will broadcast it to the network and will enter the miners’ *unconfirmed transactions pool*. After some time, a miner will pick it up alongside a set of other transactions and attempt to find the correct nonce and create the next block. The transaction is hashed into what we will refer to as the *transactionHash.* Then that hash is used in combination with all other transaction hashes in what we will refer to as the *transactionsHash.* Finally, the miner combines the *transactionsHash* with the previous block hash and looks for the correct nonce that would output a final block hash starting with a series of 0s, which we will refer to as the *blockHash*. After a while, the miner finds the solution, shares it with the rest of the network and appends the block to the blockchain. So far so good.
Now imagine that Alice wants to trick Bob and instead of sending him 1 BTC she tries to change the record to 0.5 BTC. By doing that, she inevitably changes the *transactionHash,* which in turn changes the *transactionsHash,* which consequently changes the *blockHash.* Now, the *blockHash* no longer starts with a series of 0s and the nonce is no longer valid. Therefore if Alice wanted to force that change, she would have to mine the block again and broadcast her solution. However, in the meantime, other miners are already looking for the next block which uses the previous’ block hash as a piece of the puzzle. Here it’s important to note that, by convention, the miners always use the longest chain (blockchain with most validated blocks) as the valid chain. So if Alice wants to change the block she would have to mine her block and ** the next one, faster than all the other miners, in order to produce the longest chain. However, since she has attempted to modify an existing block, she is already behind! She would have to spend a lot more energy to first catch up with the other miners and then produce the next blocks faster.
As it stands, such an attack would be extremely costly and would not be worth any change done to the transaction. This becomes even more true as the block moves deeper in the history of blocks. Indeed, if Alice wanted to change a transaction that happened 10 blocks in the past, she would have to mine all 10 blocks as they all depend, up to the latest one, on the hash of the previous block. It becomes even more costly considering the fact that a successful attack would likely be quickly identified and destroy the value of the very asset they were trying to earn more of. And that is how a combination of cryptography and well-aligned incentives produce a truly secure algorithm.
We’ve shown the economic incentive of an attack makes little sense, but what if someone wanted to attack Bitcoin just to destroy it? Is that possible? The attack described above is also known as a 51% attack, where the attacker assembles 51% of the total processing power of all miners. By owning more than half the processing power, the attacker would statistically find blocks faster and thus be able to change a block and ** produce the longer chain. At the time of writing, the total processing power of all mining operations, or *hashrate* , is 108,616,441 Which means that all miners combined, try more than one hundred million trillion nonces every second. Getting 51% of that hashrate is unimaginable, even for a nation. It would take enormous resources and mobilisation to successfully conduct such an attack. And with every increase in hash rate, this becomes less and less likely.
This is a question that often comes back. We know that block times for Bitcoin is about 10 minutes. So how does it stay at 10 minutes and what stops miners that try millions and millions of nonces to not find it within a few seconds? The Bitcoin protocol includes a mechanism called *difficulty adjustment* that prevents this from happening. Difficulty adjustment increases the pool of possible nonces to make it less likely to find the correct one. You can think of it as increasing the number of digits in the combination that unlocks the lock. If 1 000 people are looking for a five-digit combination, they are likely to find it very quickly. But if they are looking for a 100-digit combination, it will take them significantly longer. So based on the current hashrate, the difficulty adjustments computes the necessary difficulty to keep the block times around 10 minutes and maintain the bitcoin issuance rate as specified by the protocol.
You might have seen on exchanges that a transaction needs a minimum number of confirmations before your deposit can be credited. A transaction confirmation happens every time the block in which your transaction was first confirmed moves deeper in the blockchain. So, a transaction validation is when the transaction is first added to a block and transaction confirmations happen whenever a new block (based on that one) is mined. As we mentioned above, a block that is deeper in the chain is harder to revert.Therefore, a higher number of confirmations makes it more secure.
Analogies are great for simplifying abstract concepts or complex ideas but they often fall short of explaining the underlying processes. Therefore, as great as the term *bitcoin mining* is to understand its purpose (i.e.: create new bitcoins and increase circulating supply just as gold mining does), it tells you absolutely nothing about the process. In fact, it can conversely create a lot of confusion around what bitcoin mining is and undermine the importance of mining as a key factor of Bitcoin’s security, decentralisation and scalability. Indeed, with the total supply of bitcoins being capped at 21 million, bitcoin mining won’t *create new coins* forever, yet the so-called “mining” will still have to continue to validate new transactions. People can only speculate what would happen after all coins have been issued. The most likely outcome is that a fee market will develop and self-regulate to keep miners incentivised. However, we are still decades away from seeing that happening and, chances are, if Bitcoin is still around then, it will have grown into a much, much larger asset than it is today. Let us conclude this article with a small speculative projection of what such a future might be like:
Bitcoin will become the international monetary standard and validating the network will be a matter of national security and sovereignty. Fees on the first layer will be much higher (not necessarily nominaly, but in purchasing power) and transactions will consist of massive international settlements between 2nd layer liquidity providers (imagine bank settlements today) while small transactions will take place on 2nd and 3rd layer solutions with much lower fees.----

Once again, illustrating our FX observation. Basically, if it has FX in the site title, your best way to make money from it, is by betting that it's a scam. Don't be tempted to send funds to this site though, it is a hyip fraud.
Bitcoin has evolved, we now have Lightning Network, and we want to give a lot more time to this innovation in the coming months. We have done a lot to help bitcoin get to where it is, from our days mining, to all the investigations. Every site in our badlist was individually investigated by our team. Big thanks to them all.
*Can YOU imagine serving life, without parole for simply running a Website?* Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road helped establish bitcoin as a means of exchange, and we've come a long way since then, so we all owe Ross. If you are new to bitcoin, you owe him too.
It can be easy to misunderstand bitcoin, and you need to learn a few of the rules, concepts, and limitations, otherwise you are vulnerable to the swathes of scams and ponzis that try to lure you into their promises of easy money, and doubling or even 100 times multiplying your new 'Magic Internet Money'
The evolution of society beyond the demise of the failed capitalist neo-liberal experiment, first needs the evolution of it's means of trade and exchange. The current financial system, and system of fiat currency, is not fit for present or future purpose, and for all intents and purposes is already obsolete.
Incorruptible, decentralised, consensus led, and above the influence of conventional politics and economics. Bitcoin is a parallel currency with which you can begin to trade, and no middleman to take their slice or to gamble with your asset.----




http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/05/22/ongoing-debate-on-proposal-to-increase-bitcoin-block-size-to-20mb/

According to lead bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen ( ) , the best solution might be to develop a code that would allow for a larger block size. His proposal features a bitcoin hard fork that would allow any block with a timestamp on or after March 1, 2016 to be up to 20 megabytes.
“I believe this is the simplest possible set of changes that will work,” Andresen says. He even created a blog post entitled “Why Increasing the Block Size is Urgent” ( ) and discussed how blocks are already 30-40% full today.
He goes on to say that the bitcoin network will become oversaturated if the limit increase is not implemented urgently. This could cause further delays in transaction verification and could discourage people from using bitcoin as a means of payment or money transfer. “Limit the number of transactions that can happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, and instead of paying higher fees people will perform their transactions somewhere else,” he suggested.
Of course the decentralized nature of the bitcoin ecosystem makes it difficult to make decisions like these, as there is currently no leader or institution having oversight on the network. In the MIT Technology Review, author Mike Orcutt ( ) mentioned that not all members of the community such as miners, developers, customers, and startup owners agree that Andresen’s solution might be the best path to take.
Naysayers think that Andresen’s proposed 20MB block limit increase could lead to a centralization of the mining community. For them, this would favor larger and richer bitcoin miners that can handle higher block sizes.

http://ethereumj.io/

This site aims at providing you with information as to ethereum – including how you can use it in online gaming like slot sites ( ) , how to open a wallet, and the disadvantages and advantages of all these. Let us delve into this issue further:
This platform will be more prone to hacking and will be vulnerable to failure owing to power outages. When this happens, the likelihood of people hacking into the system and stealing personal information of the network users increases.
Ethereum works in avoiding such risks by operating on a decentralized system, where no one person is in charge of the operations. There is no central point hackers can target, as operations occur in computers around the globe.
The latter was the first cryptocurrency, and people often interchange cryptocurrency with the term Bitcoin. It makes sense as people often relate subsequent products to what was in place in the past. But these two currencies are quite different in that they aim to achieve different goals and solve different problems in society.
Furthermore, users can create decentralized applications using this blockchain, which can be new or built on existing ideas. The goal here is to get rid of the middleman and avoid any costs that come with having a third party involved in such processes. Think about it like this.----




https://hongkong2015.scalingbitcoin.org

The current Scaling Bitcoin Workshop will take place December 6 th -7 th at the Hong Kong Cyberport Function Rooms, Core E, Cyberport 3 100 Cyberport Road, Hong Kong Tel: (852) 3166 3800 Fax: (852) 3166 3118 . We are accepting technical proposals for improving Bitcoin performance including designs, experimental results, and comparisons against other proposals. The goals are twofold: 1) to present potential solutions to scalability challenges while identifying key areas for further research and 2) to provide a venue where researchers, developers, and miners can communicate about Bitcoin development.
We are accepting two types of proposals: one in which accepted authors will have an opportunity to give a 20-30 minute presentation at the workshop, and another where accepted authors can run an hour-long interactive workshop.
We are doing rolling acceptance, so submit your proposal as soon as you can. Proposals may be submitted as a BIP or as a 1-2 page extended abstract describing ideas, designs, and expected experimental results. Indicate in the proposal whether you are interested in speaking, running an interactive workshop, or both. If you are interested in running an interactive workshop, please include an agenda.
In recent months the Bitcoin development community has faced difficult discussions of how to safely improve the scalability and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network. To aid the technical consensus building process we are organizing a pair of workshops to collect technical criteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with academic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. This may be considered as similar in intent and process to the NIST-SHA3 design process where performance and security were in a tradeoff for a security critical application.
Since Bitcoin is a P2P currency with many stakeholders, it is important to collect requirements as broadly as possible, and through the process enhance everyone’s understanding of the technical properties of Bitcoin to help foster an inclusive, transparent, and informed process.
Scalability is not a single parameter; there are many opportunities to make the Bitcoin protocol more efficient and better able to service the needs of its growing userbase. Each approach to further scaling the Bitcoin blockchain involves implicit trade offs of desired properties of the whole system. As a community we need to raise awareness of the complex and subtle issues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing proposals, and motivate future work in this area.
The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the general tradeoffs and requirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits. Session topics are to include the presentation of experimental data relating to known bottlenecks of Bitcoin’s continued growth and analysis of implicit tradeoffs involved in general strategies for enabling future growth.
This event will not host sessions on the topic of any specific proposals involving changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Such proposals would be the topic of a 2nd, follow-on Phase 2 workshop described below; this event is intended to “set the stage” for work on and evaluation of specific proposals in the time between the workshops.
The purpose of this workshop is to present and review actual proposals for scaling Bitcoin against the requirements gathered in Phase 1. Multiple competing proposals will be presented, with experimental data, and compared against each other. The goal is to raise awareness of scalability issues and build a pathway toward consensus for increasing Bitcoin’s transaction processing capacity or, barring that, identify key areas of further required research and next steps for moving forward.
* These workshops aim to facilitate the existing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals process. Most work will be done outside of the workshops in the intervening months. The workshops serve to be additive to the design and review process by raising awareness of diverse points of view, studies, simulations and proposals.
Cory Fields is organizing an independent developer meetup that will be taking place for 2 days following the Scaling Bitcoin conference. To make it easier for people to attend, the workshop will be held at the same location, Cyberport. Please note: this meetup is not related to Scaling Bitcoin and is explicitly for developers and technical people only. This information is being posted here for convenience. Meetup information can be found here: bitcoin-dev mailing list announcement. ( )
To encourage continuity of ongoing discussions, all Phase 1 participants are invited to Phase 2 in Hong Kong at $150 USD (same as for Montreal). From November 7th, tickets may be available at $300 -- subject to availability.
( Info: ( ) ) You are responsible for figuring out your own personal visa requirements to enter the Hong Kong, SAR, China. If you need a letter of invitation, then please correspond with sindykwan at cyberport dot hk (please include your name as in your passport, title and correspondence address).
The event will be livestreamed, and you will be able to participate via IRC. Although it is naturally easier to participate in person, everyone at the event will have a desk in front of them and will be encouraged to join in online discussions with global participants who are viewing the live stream. It is also important to understand that no decisions are to be made at the workshop. (read more below)
You can submit your proposal to proposals@scalingbitcoin.org (see CFP above). If you’ve worked on research, we recommend that you post the results, including papers, simulation results, and source code, to the bitcoin-dev discussion list ( ). Depending on the quantity of accepted presentations, the workshop will allot a fair amount of time to each presenter. If people have substantially overlapping plans, they may be suggested to merge. Publishing a paper is NOT required—if you have a good presentation plan, you can propose a detailed summary.
Absolutely no decisions are made at workshops, as this would run the risk of being rushed and unfair to the global community unable to attend in person. The workshop is about raising awareness of issues and proposals, finding common ground, and encouraging public discussion within the existing mechanism of technical progress through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process.
There will probably be no debate, and the workshop organizers and participants will be operating with the goal of making the event low-stress and non-confrontational. The intent of the workshops are to showcase diverse points of view and promote open-mindedness in order to improve our collective understanding of how to improve Bitcoin’s scalability. In-person debates could too easily do a disservice to the future of Bitcoin in being about solidifying simplified positions for the purpose of winning political points. It would be unreasonable to entrust the safety and security of the future of Bitcoin to smooth talking at a one-time event rather than deliberate technical study with time for the global community to weigh in.
These first two workshops in Montreal and Hong Kong are focused on raising technical awareness of scalability issues, simulations and proposals to improve scalability. For now the participants want this to be entirely focused on the science and engineering, which is how Open Source Software development has proven to deliver excellence.
Some have proposed the workshops become regular events for working on technical issues, after the second currently in planning for Hong Kong. For example, a third workshop has been proposed to be held at MIT’s campus or in New York City. Some have also proposed that we write a BIP on how to organize workshops. These workshops are a work in progress; we will make some mistakes and learn how to do it better the next time. For now, let’s make the first two workshops a success, as that will inform how to define their organization in a written BIP and how to conduct further productive workshops. If you’re interested in discussing future workshops, please join the bitcoin-workshops discussion list ( ).
Opening Party (Saturday 5th December): A very casual and informal opening party will be held at Liberty Exchange from 8-10pm. Some finger foods will be served for 2 hours but you'll need to pay for your own drinks. After 10pm, there will be a walking tour of Lan Kwai Fong.
Reception (Sunday 6th December): At 7pm buses have been arranged to take us from Cyberport to The Hooray Bar and Grill in time for the Symphony of Lights show. There will be unlimited food and drinks for two hours from from 7.30pm-9.30pm.----




http://cointimes.tech/2016/08/23/when-should-developers-turn-to-bitcoin/

Bitcoin is currently bringing investors joy above all else. In its wake, the best-known digital currency is dragging hundreds of other cryptocurrencies ever higher. But how substantial is the development?
“No, we don’t have a crash here,” Julian says in his latest video on YouTube, reassuring his 100,000 subscribers after bitcoin’s recent slide. ″Such setbacks are quite normal and it may even wash out this hype″, says the self-proclaimed Austrian crypto explainer, who explains the world of digital currencies from Singapore. Hosp is a former professional kite surfer and sees himself as an investor and advisor. By his own admission, he holds many coins – as the various digital currencies are called in the crypto world. But his biggest project is his own digital currency, with which he wants to make money flows such as loans, payment systems and stock trading accessible without middlemen.
A recent price slide in bitcoin of almost 20 percent is already routine for Hosp, he explains in his video. But on balance, the 34-year-old has probably profited well from the hype surrounding digital currencies. Bitcoin, in particular, has increased more than sixfold since its low in March 2020. Anyone who bought Bitcoins as recently as December of last year can now look forward to seeing their value double. The situation is similar for other digital currencies. The largest after Bitcoin is called Ethereum. But names like Ripple, Litecoin and Cadano are also making the rounds. The list of all cryptocurrencies is long. Bitcoin still unites the most invested money.
But why, apart from extravagant crypto preachers like Hosp, are more and more people believing in the blockchain and putting their money into a completely dematerialized product? After all, behind digital currencies there is often not much more than sophisticated code that, in the case of Bitcoin, for example, enables financial transactions to be carried out quickly, anonymously and cheaply.
Socially, one could argue that the hype represents another step in the digital transformation accelerated in the pandemic. The column of numbers is becoming a tangible commodity for some. The fact that confidence in digital assets is on the rise is also shown by the stock prices of technology companies, which have climbed to dizzying heights in – or as a result of – the Corona pandemic.
For Sören, an economist and crypto analyst at DZ Bank, the reasons lie primarily in the expansionary monetary policy of international central banks. What he means: there is a lot of money on the market and interest rates will hardly be available in the longer term. “Investors now see themselves forced to consider more unusual asset classes,” Hettler writes when asked. Bitcoins are still extraordinary. For example, the value of all Bitcoins on the coinmarketcap.com ( ) platform was $640 billion. That sounds a lot, but in comparison it is somewhat less than the stock market value of the at least equally hyped electric car pioneer Tesla.
But in addition to crypto freaks, institutional investors are also increasingly jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Patrick Hansen of industry association Bitkom, for example, believes that Bitcoin’s price rise is also due to the fact that ″companies and investors are shifting their capital reserves into Bitcoin″, according to Hansen.
This includes more and more reputable companies such as insurance company MassMutual and asset manager One River, which recently acquired $600 million worth of Bitcoins. Meanwhile, one asset manager also owns the most Bitcoins worldwide: Graytrust from New York combines almost three percent of all available Bitcoins. In a video on its website, Graytrust promoted the benefits: Gold bars fall from the sky, people pull on them, there are distribution struggles. The message: digital currencies are safer than physical gold.
The comparison between bitcoin and gold is often used to explain digital currency. Both are limited in quantity as a resource. That’s how inventor Satoshi Nakamoto intended it in Bitcoin’s code. But gold has long been accepted worldwide as a store of value (“safe haven”). Bitcoin is still a long way from widespread acceptance – which partly explains the massive price fluctuations.
* In my opinion, a really convincing model that can be used to calculate an appropriate price ″does not currently exist,″ the blockchain analyst said. “Cryptocurrencies are worth what others are willing to pay for them.”
Another reason for the growing interest is access. While it used to be possible only for tech nerds to buy cryptocurrencies and store them on their phones or computers, that’s becoming easier, too. The best example is payment processor Paypal, which announced in October that its customers in the U.S. can buy and sell bitcoin and three other cryptocurrencies. Worldwide, Paypal has more than 350 million customers – many of whom may soon be dealing with digital currencies for the first time.
However, cryptocurrencies have so far continued to be one thing above all else: a gambler’s property that has brought big profits to some and massive losses to others. As with any growth market, this also attracts black sheep. Bitcoin is also repeatedly criticized because it enables criminals to carry out transactions via the blockchain. The example of the digital currency Ripple also suggests that there are people at the controls of the coins who are primarily interested in increasing their own capital. Shortly before Christmas, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple and two of its founders. The accusation: transactions of 1.8 billion dollars are said to have not proceeded in a regular manner. The trial will take place in February.
The blockchain expert at the digital association Bitkom assumes that of the thousands of cryptocurrencies, “the vast majority have no long-term raison d’être.” However, financial regulators would keep a very close eye on the larger digital currencies.
Crypto explainer Julian Hosp is not without controversy either. For example, there are reports on the web about insider trading at a failed startup. In any case, Hosp continues to back digital currencies. He is not afraid of a crash. After the sharp drop in the value of the Bitcoin, he sees “the healthy downward correction” above all, a favorable opportunity to buy Bitcoins. Currently, everything indicates “that it will continue to go up,” Hosp said in one of his videos.
For DZ Bank expert Sören Hettler, it’s mainly the expectation that “people’s openness to cryptocurrencies and thus their general acceptance by the public will increase.” However, whether the current Bitcoin rally is another bubble “cannot be said at this point in time.”----




https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/09/18/private-blockchain-is-just-a-confusing-name-for-a-shared-database/

Banks and financial institutions seem to be all over ( ) the blockchain. It seems they agree with the Bitcoin community that the technology behind Bitcoin can provide an efficient platform for settlement and for issuing digital assets. Curiously, though, they seem to shy away from Bitcoin itself. Instead, they want something they have more control over and doesn’t require exposing transactions publicly. Besides, Bitcoin has too much of an association in the media with theft, crime, and smut — no place for serious, upstanding bankers. As a result, the buzz in the financial industry is about “private blockchains.”
The key to Bitcoin’s security (and success) is its decentralization which comes from its innovative use of proof-of-work mining. However, if you have a blockchain where only a few companies are allowed to participate, proof-of-work doesn’t make sense any more. You’re left with a system where a set of identified (rather than pseudonymous) parties maintain a shared ledger, keeping tabs on each other so that no single party controls the database. What is it about a blockchain that makes this any better than using a regular replicated database?
Supporters argue that the blockchain’s crypto, including signatures and hash pointers, is what distinguishes a private blockchain from a vanilla shared database. The crypto makes the system harder to tamper with and easier to audit. But these aspects of the blockchain weren’t Bitcoin’s innovation! In fact, Satoshi tweaked them only slightly from the earlier research that he cites in his whitepaper — research by Haber and Stornetta ( ) going all the way back to 1991!
* It is true that adding signatures and hash pointers makes a shared database a bit more secure. However, it’s qualitatively different from the level of security, irreversibility, and censorship-resistance you get with the public blockchain.
* The use of these crypto techniques for building a tamper-resistant database has been known for 25 years. At first there wasn’t much impetus for Wall Street to pay attention, but gradually there has arisen a great opportunity in moving some types of financial infrastructure to an automated, cryptographically secured model.
* For banks to go this route, they must learn about the technology, get everyone to the same table, and develop and deploy a standard. The blockchain conveniently solves these problems due to the hype around it. In my view, it’s not the novelty of blockchain technology but rather its mindshare that has gotten Wall Street to converge on it, driven by the fear of missing out. It’s acted as a focal point ( ) for standardization.
* To build these private blockchains, banks start with the Bitcoin Core code and rip out all the parts they don’t need. It’s a bit like hammering in a thumb tack, but if a hammer is readily available and no one’s told you that thumb tacks can be pushed in by hand, there’s nothing particularly wrong with it.
Chaining blocks of transactions together for known actors in highly valuable transactions (like say a $100M corporate loan) can actually solve significant bank cost and regulation challenges. This is no different to a VPN for secure networking.
There may be possible futures in which that is a permissioned set of app logic on top of Bitcoin (and or Ethereum), but for right now, I’m not sure Bitcoin, in the middle of the BIP 100 XT debacle is up to that task.
There seems to be an obsession with the fact that a censorship resistant thing was created. Therefore we should use that censorship resistant thing, for everything, because censorship resistance is what we want…
If you’re a bank, you don’t want censorship resistance. So why would you use Bitcoin in it’s current state? It doesn’t meet the functional and non functional requirements of banking. There may however be things you can do today, that solve business challenges and – if – the open source community gets Bitcoin (or an alternate) up to where it needs to be, then great. Migrate, share, merge, side… chain your way on there.
First off, chaining blocks together in a replicated database has been done since the 70’s. Prior to the hype of bitcoin, we called that “journaling”. What that has to do with a VPN… I’m not sure.
Blockchains that aren’t censorship resistance have been in full deployment for years. SWIFT, ACH, etc. They are all permissioned, however, the economics of this model has been such that a central provider (which is typically efficienct because a counterparty to the transactions is a mediator) are more cost efficient.
*The only* efficiency of a blockchain is regulatory arbitrage. Permissioned ledgers offer no such efficiency. If you’re wondering how we unraveled the flash crash of 2010 – it’s through the commonplace time-tested, and centralized database technology of the 20th century. A blockchain would have only increased the obfuscation to this process. If you don’t believe this, ask any blockchain developer how he queries his blockchain – the answer will always be “via an rdms which indexes the blocks”
a) Yes, a “private blockchain” is just a shared database. Really, it’s the shared database part that’s the interesting product, and the private blockchain is just the mechanism which enables it to happen. Perhaps other mechanisms exist as well.
b) The innovations on which private blockchains depend have indeed been around for decades. Similarly the innovations on which the world wide web depended were around for decades before its invention. In both cases, something interesting still happens when these innovations are combined together to create a new product.
c) The signatures and hash pointers aren’t the only interesting thing about private blockchains. Also, it’s the way in which the security model is redesigned to enable safe write access by multiple non-trusting (and even fiercely competitive) parties. The mechanism is either per-transaction constraints (Bitcoin style) or forced use of stored procedures (Ethereum style). Again, perhaps other mechanisms exist, but neither of these two are standard features of today’s databases.
d) Forking from Bitcoin Core (as we’ve also done with MultiChain) or other public blockchain codebases is indeed only the first step towards implementing scalable enterprise-class private blockchains (or if you prefer, safe shared-write distributed databases). But it’s a quick and convenient way to get to something usable for pilot projects and R&D. In the long term, I believe that there will be a convergence between private blockchains and SQL-driven RDBMSes.
It’s not quite true that a blockchain is just a shared database. The key is that it has no centralized control, and is secure it. If a bank adopts for example T0’s solution based on PeerNova’s authenticated database, they introduce a new gatekeeper. The whole point is that they don’t want a new gatekeeper, they want a blockchain.
Future blockchains will be better described as ledgers. They will not use Proof of Work, which is already obsolete: far superior consensus algorithms already exist in the wings that don’t require delays, burning of electricity etc. These future ledgers will use server identities, which can be made Sybil resistant where the network is open using different techniques, and simply dealt out by a trusted dealer in the case of settlement and clearing (for example by an industry association).
The main point, anyway, is that decentralized ledgers have huge advantages over shared databases, and that future ledgers will not have the performance problems of Bitcoin and related systems. Anyone interested in scaling decentralized systems generally should keep an eye on dfinity.io where various new techniques and consensus math will appear over coming months.
Mostly agree with your position. Would add one area of differentiation between private blockchain and a database. With a centrally managed database the cost associated with queries is born by the centralized entity while the cost of a query on the blockchain is born by the entity that wants the data. If the solution is a large quantity of public data that is accessed frequently, providing downloaded snapshots of the data may prove economically beneficial over support for remote queries.
I agree. it is like a cancer cell growing on the vein. Transparency is just too hard for banks to commit. I wonder how they try to use quantum crypto into this strangely sounding phrase – ‘private blockchain’.

http://www.multichain.com/blog/2016/03/blockchains-vs-centralized-databases/

If you’ve been reading my previous posts, you will know by now that blockchains are simply a new type of database ( ). That is, a database which can be directly shared, in a write sense, by a group of non-trusting parties, without requiring a central administrator. This contrasts with traditional (SQL or NoSQL) databases that are controlled by a single entity, even if some kind of distributed architecture is used within its walls.
I recently gave a talk ( ) about blockchains from the perspective of information security, in which I concluded that blockchains are more secure than regular databases in some ways, and less secure in others. Considering the leading role ( ) that centralized databases play in today’s technology stack, this got me thinking more broadly about the trade-offs between these two technologies. Indeed, whenever someone asks me if MultiChain ( ) can be used for a particular purpose, my first response is always: “Could you do that with a regular database?” In more cases than you might think, the answer is yes, for the following simple reason:
This is a key point on which there is so much misunderstanding. In terms of the types of data that can be stored, and the transactions that can be performed on that data, blockchains don’t do anything new. And just to be clear, this observation extends to “smart contracts” as well, despite their sexy name and image. A smart contract is nothing more than a piece of computer code which runs on every node in a blockchain – a decades-old technology called stored procedures ( ) does the same for centralized databases. (You also cannot use a blockchain if this code needs to initiate interactions with the outside world.)
The truth about blockchains is that, while they have some advantages, they also have their downsides. In other words, like most technology decisions, the choice between a blockchain and a regular database comes down to a series of trade-offs. If you’re blinded by the hype and deafened by the noise, you’re unlikely to make that choice objectively. So I hope the following guide might help.
The core value of a blockchain is enabling a database to be directly shared across boundaries of trust, without requiring a central administrator. This is possible because blockchain transactions contain their own proof of validity and their own proof of authorization, instead of requiring some centralized application logic to enforce those constraints. Transactions can therefore be verified and processed independently by multiple “nodes”, with the blockchain acting as a consensus mechanism to ensure those nodes stay in sync.
Why is there value in this disintermediation? Because even though a database is just bits and bytes, *it is also a tangible thing*. The contents of a database are stored in the memory and disk of a particular computer system, and anybody with sufficient access to that system can destroy or corrupt the data within. As a result, the moment you entrust your data to a regular database, you also become dependent on the human organization in which that database resides.
Now, the world is filled with organizations which have earned this trust – governments and banks (mostly), universities, trade associations, and even private companies like Google and Facebook. In most cases, especially in the developed world, these work extremely well. I believe my vote has always been counted, no bank has ever stolen my money, and I’m yet to find a way to pay for better grades. So what’s the problem? If an organization controls an important database, it also needs a bunch of people and processes in place to prevent that database being tampered with. People need hiring, processes need to be designed, and all this takes a great deal of time and money.
So blockchains offer a way to replace these organizations with a distributed database, locked down by clever cryptography. Like so much that has come before, they leverage the ever-increasing capacity of computer systems to provide a new way of replacing humans with code. And once it’s been written and debugged, code tends to be an awful lot cheaper.
As I mentioned, every node in a blockchain independently verifies and processes every transaction. A node can do this because it has full visibility into: (a) the database’s current state, (b) the modification requested by a transaction, and (c) a digital signature which proves the transaction’s origin. This is undoubtedly a clever new way to architect a database, and it really works. So where’s the catch? For many applications, especially financial, the full transparency enjoyed by every node is an absolute deal-killer.
How do systems built on regular databases avoid this problem? Just like blockchains, they restrict the transactions that particular users can perform, but these restrictions are imposed in one central location. As a result, the full database contents need only be visible at that location, rather than in multiple nodes. Requests to read data also go through this central authority, which can accept or reject those requests as it sees fit. In other words, if a regular database is read-controlled and write-controlled, a blockchain can be write-controlled only.
To be fair, many strategies are available for mitigating this problem. These range from simple ideas like transacting under multiple blockchain addresses, to advanced cryptographic techniques such as confidential transactions ( ) and zero-knowledge proofs ( ) (now being developed). Nonetheless, the more information you want to hide on a blockchain, the heavier a computational burden you pay to generate and verify transactions. And no matter how these techniques develop, they will never beat the simple and straightforward method of hiding data completely.
A second benefit of blockchain-powered databases is extreme fault tolerance, which stems from their built-in redundancy. Every node processes every transaction, so no individual node is crucial to the database as a whole. Similarly, nodes connect to each other in a dense peer-to-peer fashion, so many communication links can fail before things grind to a halt. The blockchain ensures that nodes which went down can always catch up on transactions they missed.
So while it’s true that regular databases offer many techniques for replication ( ) , blockchains take this to a whole new level. For a start, no configuration is required – simply connect some blockchain nodes together, and they automatically keep themselves in sync. In addition, nodes can be freely added or removed from a network, without any preparation or consequences. Lastly, external users can send their transactions to any node, or to multiple nodes simultaneously, and these transactions propagate automatically and seamlessly to everyone else.
This robustness transforms the economics of database availability. With regular databases, high availability is achieved through a combination of expensive infrastructure and disaster recovery ( ). A primary database runs on high-end hardware which is monitored closely for problems, with transactions replicated to a backup system in a different physical location. If the primary database fails (e.g. due to a power cut or catastrophic hardware failure), activity is automatically moved over to the backup, which becomes the new primary. Once the failed system is fixed, it’s lined up to act as the new backup if and when necessary. While all this is doable, it’s expensive and notoriously difficult to get right.
Instead, what if we had 10 blockchain nodes running in different parts of the world, all on commodity hardware? These nodes would be densely connected to each other, sharing transactions on a peer-to-peer basis and using a blockchain to ensure consensus. End users generating the transactions connect to (say) 5 of these nodes, so it doesn’t matter if a few communication links go down. And if one or two nodes fail completely on any given day, nobody feels a thing, because there are still more than enough copies to go round. As it happens, this combination of low cost systems and high redundancy is exactly how Google built its search engine so cheaply ( ). Blockchains can do the same thing for databases.
Blockchains will always be slower than centralized databases. It’s not just that today’s blockchains are slow because the technology is new and unoptimized, but it’s a result of the nature of blockchains themselves. You see, when processing transactions, a blockchain has to do all the same things as a regular database, but it carries three additional burdens:
* *Signature verification*. Every blockchain transaction must be digitally signed using a public-private cryptography scheme such as ECDSA ( ). This is necessary because transactions propagate between nodes in a peer-to-peer fashion, so their source cannot otherwise be proven. The generation and verification of these signatures is computationally complex, and constitutes the primary bottleneck in products like ours. By contrast, in centralized databases, once a connection has been established, there is no need to individually verify every request that comes over it.
* *Consensus mechanisms*. In a distributed database such as a blockchain, effort must be expended in ensuring that nodes in the network reach consensus. Depending on the consensus mechanism used, this might involve significant back-and-forth communication dealing with forks and their consequent rollbacks. While it’s true that centralized databases must also contend with conflicting and aborted transactions, these are far less likely where transactions are queued and processed in a single location.
* *Redundancy*. This isn’t about the performance of an individual node, but the total amount of computation that a blockchain requires. Whereas centralized databases process transactions once (or twice), in a blockchain they must be processed independently by every node in the network. So lots more work is being done for the same end result.
Naturally there are other ways in which blockchains and regular databases can be compared. We could talk about codebase maturity, developer attractiveness, ecosystem breadth and more. But none of these issues are inherent to the technology itself. So when it comes to a long-term decision on using a blockchain, the question to ask is this: What’s more important for my use case? Disintermediation and robustness? Or confidentiality and performance?
When examined in this simple light, many of the use cases currently under discussion *do not make sense*. The biggest problem tends to be confidentiality. The participants in a fiercely competitive marketplace will naturally prefer the privacy of a centralized database, rather than reveal their activities to each other. This is especially true if a trusted central party already exists and can provide the neutral territory in which that database can reside. Even though there may be some cost associated with this central provider, this is more than justified by the value of the privacy retained. The only motivation for a shift to blockchains would be aggressive new regulation.
Nonetheless blockchains do have strong use cases, where disintermediation and robustness are more important than confidentiality and performance. I’ll write more about these in a subsequent post, but the most promising areas we’ve seen so far are: (a) inter-company audit trails, (b) provenance tracking, and (c) lightweight financial systems. In all three cases, we’ve found people building on MultiChain with a clear view to deployment, rather than just curiosity and experimentation. So if you’re looking for ways in which blockchains can add genuine value to your business, they might be a good place to start.----

*Ethereum price* today is $2,355.33 with a 24-hour trading volume of $21,461,380,820. ETH price is down -13.4% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 120 Million ETH coins and a total supply of ∞. If you are looking to buy or sell Ethereum, WhiteBIT ( ) is currently the most active exchange.
Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps ( dapps ( ) ) that are built on Ethereum includes token, non-fungible tokens ( ) , decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.
Using a smart contract, Alice has bypassed the need to have a trusted third-party intermediary (lawyers, escrow agents etc) to send the trust fund to Bob and made the process transparent to all involved parties.
There are two popular programming languages that are typically used to write Ethereum smart contracts. The first one is called Solidity which has very close similarities to Javascript and C++. The other language is called Vyper which is relatively new that has very close similarities to Python.
Unlike bitcoin ( ) in which the creator who is known as Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The founding team of Ethereum are known individuals which includes Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di lorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilke. Not all the founding members are still with the Ethereum Foundation, as some has moved on to work on other projects. For example, Charles Hoskinson has moved on to work on Cardano ( ) , while Gavin Wood has moved on to work on Polkadot ( ).
While Ethereum refers to the blockchain network. The native currency that flows within the Ethereum economy is called Ether (ETH). Ether is typically used to pay for transaction fees called Gas, and it is the base currency of the network.
On Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in ETH.
The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand. If there are more people interacting on the Ethereum blockchain such as transacting in ETH or executing a smart contract operation, due to the limited amount of computing resources on the network, Gas price can increase. Conversely when the network is under utilized, the market price of gas would decrease.
Ethereum 2.0 is an upgrade that aims to solve the blockchain trilemma - security, scalability, and decentralization. In alternative smart contract platforms, they are designed to be highly scalable but compromises on decentralization. Whereas a highly secured and decentralized blockchain network would have the trade off being highly unscalable. Ethereum 2.0 brings a very different flavor of design that aims to addresses those issues by way of using Proof-of-Stake (POS), Beacon Chain, Sharding, and Execution Environment. Due to the complexity of the project, the developement will take place in 3 phases. A Proof-of-Stake Beacon Chain have been deployed and users are staking their ETH as a sign of confidence of the upcoming network. Research and development are still in progress to roll out the remaining phases.

According to a press release sent to CoinReport, Lisk’s vision is to have a highly scalable public blockchain in which decentralized applications – or dapps – can be programmed without the creator needing to master often complex languages of individual blockchains, as Lisk uses JavaScript for blockchain app development.
The release of Lisk v 0.3.0 follows a four-week initial coin offering (ICO) for the cryptocurrency (LSK), which ended March 21, 2016. The ICO raised more than 14,000 bitcoins and 80 million crypti (80 percent of the existing market) for a total of $6.5 million. On the final day of the crowdsale, the price of those assets were $5.75 million, according to the press release, but an increase in bitcoin’s valuation since then boosted the crowdsale proceeds.
Lisk is the brainchild of Max Kordek (CEO) and Oliver Beddows (CTO), who hail from Germany and the UK, respectively. The pair were active members of the team developing crypti ( ) , a fork of whose code was used to create Lisk.
“At this moment it’s rocket science to create decentralized technologies or applications; with Lisk this becomes dramatically simpler,” he said. “We hope that our platform smooths the way for a lot of decentralized applications around the world, be it in the social network, sharing economy or Internet of Things industry.”
A sidechain, Kordek explained, is another blockchain that runs next to the primordial blockchain. “It can have its own logic, purpose, and consensus mechanism,” he said, “however, you can send the token of value from the primordial blockchain to the sidechain back and forth.”
Kordek said Lisk chose JavaScript because it’s one of the most popular coding languages in the world, providing Lisk with a strong, existing user base. There are lots of people behind this versatile language, improving it every day. “In terms of apps I believe that JavaScript apps are the future,” he said.
Kordek became active in the cryptocurrency community in 2013, when he started mining litecoin ( ). “That was in my one-room student apartment,” he recalled. “The heat and noise were unbearable, therefore after about four weeks I turned [the mining pool] off.”
Kordek discovered Nxt one month after the cryptocurrency’s launch. He rose through the ranks of the Nxt community, becoming CEO of the Nxt Organization ( ). He later left over conflicting views about development.
While active with Nxt, Kordek read about the crypti ICO. He later met with one of the founders in Aachen, Germany and became a member of the team as a community manager, working on promotion, design and concepts.
“With so much money we now have the potential to become one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry and develop one of the first products with a real use-case,” he said. According to another press release ( ) , issued yesterday, Lisk said IOU trading in recent weeks peaked at approximately $7.23 or 0.0164 BTC per LSK. The release said the IOU was currently trading at $2.5 per LSK, making it the third largest cryptocurrency with a $250 million market cap.
“Until now, not a single blockchain based application or technology is really being used by the masses,” said Kordek to CoinReport. “We think we can change that, by providing an alternative decentralized application directory.”
Kordek explained to CoinReport that participants in the ICO generated a passphrase, which equals their public-private key pair on the mainnet launching today. In the blog post published yesterday, he wrote that individuals who did not validate their passphrases on the ICO website will be contacted in a few days.
Asked about Lisk’s approach to getting its token added to exchanges, Kordek said trading is not a priority at the moment, as the team is focusing on the development and promotion of the Lisk platform.
What’s key to development is community involvement. “[It’s] important to us because Lisk can only survive with an active and loyal community,” said Kordek. “They are testing our updates, checking out the blockchain apps, and [securing] the network.”
On Saturday, Lisk held its inaugural biweekly community meeting ( ) , held through an online chat. The team outlined its progress leading up to the mainnet launch, and took questions from the Lisk community.
Lisk also has a cohort of country ambassadors ( ) , who promote the Lisk ecosystem and provide community support in their native countries. “Lisk is a worldwide platform and should therefore be present in every country on earth,” said Kordek.
“Due to the close relationship with our community we see who is active and might be a good candidate,” he added. “[Joel O. Fernández], our community manager, created a few guidelines to see if someone would be a good country ambassador or not. If they are, we contact them and ask if they are interested.”
As for the cryptocurrency community in Kordek’s home country, Germany, it’s virtually non-existent. “They are a lot of users, but nobody is talking about it,” he said. While he’s aware of active communities in London and Amsterdam, he can’t speculate on the interest in Europe as a whole, but “I think there is a lot of room to grow and everything is just getting started,” he said.
“The reception of cryptocurrencies is bad because the average citizen [doesn’t] understand it,” Kordek said. “People always fight what they don’t understand. The governments and regulators lag behind as they always do. However, I can see some movements in that regard. We are definitely living in interesting times and it will be very exciting [to see] how all of this plays out.”

https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2018/04/27/bull-vs-bear-is-blockchain-the-future-of-ad-tech/

*There is a lot of talk about blockchain having the potential to disrupt industries ranging from agriculture to online dating and, yes, advertising too. Johannes Heinze (pictured below), MD international, AppLovin, has even made the case ( ) that blockchain might be the future of mobile advertising. That said, there’s a lot of irrational exuberance and misunderstanding about blockchain technology going around. Writing exclusively for ExchangeWire, Heinze brings two different viewpoints on what blockchain can actually do for the industry.*
To help clarify the discussion, what follows is my best attempt at presenting the most credible, buzzword- and jargon-free representations of both the bull and the bear cases for the future of blockchain and ad tech.
Let’s quickly go over how blockchain works ( ). Blockchain is built on a distributed database rather than a central server, and each linked block of data has a unique timestamp, making it an ideal technology for peer-to-peer transactions and exchanges, such as a programmatic ad market. Because blockchain transactions are entirely digital, they are transparent, making them attractive to both the buy and the sell sides of the programmatic market.
Blockchain programmatic also involves fewer parties and settlements that are near-real-time. This is very meaningful for developers forced to wait weeks, or months, to receive ad payments and who also want the increased transparency that blockchain offers.
MadHive ( ) , EnvisionX ( ) , Ternio ( ) , and Bitcasts ( ) are a few early entrants that are finding ways to create and incentivise programmatic ad markets. Kochava launched its blockchain digital ad platform, XCHNG ( ) , with the goal of increasing transparency between buyers and sellers.
Combined with the evolution of AI, the opening of secondary data markets, the advent of new ad formats (programmatic for voice-activated assistants ( ) , programmatic for dynamic insertions into podcasts ( ) , programmatic for in-app video AR ( ) ), and growing demand for ad inventory in developing markets, including India and China, it’s easy to see how demand and inventory for blockchain-powered programmatic ads could soar in the coming years, if and when these new channels achieve scale.
Because transactions and changes must be recorded in each node of the blockchain, blocks get very big, very fast. As a result, storage demands increase proportionally, driving huge power consumption, which comes with greater expense and environmental outcomes, but this will be resolved as the technology progresses.
And, because the nodes are plentiful and so quick to grow, yet functionally separate, it takes significantly longer to process a blockchain transaction than a 'normal' programmatic ad. While traditional programmatic ads can conduct millions of transactions per second, blockchain can only achieve about 2,000 transactions in the same time ( ) , though companies are already working around this ( ). From a broader perspective, there is concern with the potential for fraud in blockchain’s most obvious application: cryptocurrency. In the last 10 years, about 20% of all bitcoins have been stolen or hacked ( ).
Another very real concern is that less-than-reputable entities will flood the blockchain programmatic market early on. This, in turn, will create trust barriers that prevent early adopters from returning to the market, and conservative players from ever entering it. As Kai Stinchcombe, founder and CEO at True Link Financial – a staunch critic of blockchain computing methods – wrote on Medium ( ) : “Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with... in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world.”
Last but not least, there is no good existing model for marketers and developers to understand optimal KPIs in blockchain programmatic. These KPIs will be influenced by slower performance and other technological differences, compared to those in traditional programmatic advertising. Globally, very few major buyers have interest in spending big on technical solutions absent proven use cases; and that’s exactly what blockchain for programmatic is.
With publishers and advertisers seeking to increase margins and simplify the buying and selling process, the freedom offered by blockchain methods could dovetail nicely with the broader evolution of programmatic ads, but that is far from a given.
Big questions still remain, like will blockchain-powered transactions ever go mainstream and, if so, what will the long-term impacts of that evolution be on traditional programmatic markets? Will blockchain programmatic CPM rates universally deflate in order to compete?
It’s impossible to know the answers to these questions at this point but, on balance, blockchain-powered programmatic ads, which are already a reality today, seem poised to shake up traditional programmatic advertising.----




https://onlinemarketingscoops.com/the-5-biggest-blockchain-trends-in-2022/

Blockchain is one of the most exciting tech trends at the moment. It is a distributed, encrypted database model that has the potential to solve many problems around online trust and security. Many people know it as the technology that underpins Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. However, its potential uses are far broader, encompassing digital “ smart ( ) ” contracts, logistics and supply chain provenance and security, and protection against identity theft ( ).
There are countless others – blockchain evangelists say it can potentially be used to improve security and integrity in any system that involves multiple parties sharing access to a database. During 2022, spending on blockchain solutions by businesses is forecast to hit $11.7 billion ( ). Here are some of the trends that will be driving this and some thoughts on how this will impact more and more lives over the course of the next year.
Blockchains ( ) can potentially use a lot of energy and create high levels of carbon emissions – this fact was behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s decision to temporarily stop accepting Bitcoin in payment for his cars earlier in 2021. For this very good reason, during 2022, we are likely to see a great deal of emphasis on attempts to “greenify” blockchain. There are a few ways this can be done, including carbon offsetting, although many people consider that this often equates to simply patching up a wound that shouldn’t have been caused in the first place.
Another is by moving to less energy-intensive models of blockchain technology – typically those that rely on ( ) “proof-of-stake” algorithms rather than “proof-of-work” to generate consensus. Ethereum ( ) – the second best-known blockchain after Bitcoin – plans to move to a POS model during 2022. Another route to a greener operating model is the one championed by Cathy Wood, CEO of tech-focused hedge fund Ark Invest. This posits the view that growing demand for energy will lead to greater investments into generating renewable energy ( ) , which will then be used for other applications as well as operating blockchains.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) were the big news in the blockchain scene during 2021. Astronomical prices ( ) achieved by artwork such as Beeple’s The First 5000 Days created plenty of headlines, placing the concept of unique digital tokens residing on blockchains firmly in the public consciousness. It’s also firmly taken hold in the music world, with artists including Kings of Leon, Shawn Mendes, and Grimes all releasing tracks in NFT format. But like blockchain in general, the idea has potential beyond it’s first publicity-grabbing use cases.
Distillers William Grant and Son recently sold bottles of 46-year-old Glenfiddich whisky alongside NFTs ( ) , which are used to prove each bottle’s provenance. NFTs in gaming are starting to take off in a big way – monster-breeding game Axie Infinity allows players to “mint” their own NFT creatures to send into battle and currently has around 300,000 concurrent players (Fortnite, for comparison, has around 3.5 million). Dolce & Gabbana and Nike have both created clothing and footwear that come with their own NFTs. And the metaverse ( ) concept – championed this year by Facebook, Microsoft, and Nvidia – brings plenty of opportunities for innovative NFT use cases ( ).
2021 saw El Salvador become among the first nations to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, meaning it can be accepted across the country to pay for goods and services, and businesses can use it to pay their employees. According to many commentators, during 2022, we will see a number of other countries follow suit.
Alexander Hoptner, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, predicts ( ) that at least five developing countries will start to accept Bitcoin next year, driven by global inflation and growing remittance fees from financial “middlemen” organizations used to send money home by overseas workers.
National cryptocurrencies – where central banks create their own coins that they can control, rather than adopting existing decentralized coins – are another area where we will see growth in 2022. These projects typically involve digital currencies that will operate alongside existing traditional currencies, allowing users to conduct their own transactions and manage their custody without relying on third-party service providers, while also allowing the central banks to keep control of the circulating supply – keeping the value of the token pegged to the value of the country’s traditional currency.
While the UK government-endorsed Britcoin ( ) is unlikely to be ready for launch during 2022, others, including China, Singapore, Tunisia, and Ecuador, have already done so, with more, including Japan, Russia, Sweden, and Estonia likely to join soon.
Blockchain is hugely compatible with the idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) ( ) because it is great for creating records of interactions and transactions between machines. It can potentially help to solve many problems around security as well as scalability due to the automated, encrypted, and immutable nature of blockchain ledgers and databases. It could even be used for machine-to-machine transactions – enabling micropayments to be made via cryptocurrencies when one machine or network needs to procure services from another.
While this is an advanced use case that may involve us traveling a little further down the road before it impacts our day-to-day lives, it’s likely we will start to hear about more pilot projects and initial use cases in this field during 2022. Innovation in this field is likely to be driven by the ongoing rollout of 5G networks, meaning greater connectivity between all manner of smart, networked equipment and appliances – not simply in terms of speed, but also new types of data transactions including blockchain transactions.
It’s now clear that tackling the Covid-19 global pandemic will continue to be a priority throughout 2022 and a key use case for many of this year’s top tech trends. Blockchain technology has several important potential use cases in vaccine tracking and distribution.
( ) In a world where counterfeiters are known to be creating and selling fake vaccines ( ) , blockchain means the authenticity of vaccine shipments can be proven, and their distribution can be traced to ensure they are arriving at their intended locations. There’s also a need to ensure integrity at every point of the supply chain – for example, to ensure batches of vaccines are consistently stored at the correct temperature, as is needed by many of them. IBM has created a system to allow coordination between the many different and varied agencies and healthcare authorities involved with vaccine distribution, using blockchain to unify recording of vaccination rates and efficacy across the various tools and platforms they all have in use. A pilot project also showed how blockchain could potentially speed up the ability to recognize where a product recall might be needed – for example, in a case where a batch seems to be causing an unusually high occurrence of side-effects – from three days to just a few seconds ( ). Breakthroughs that come about due to the unprecedented response to this pandemic are likely to go on to enable more use cases for blockchain technology in the manufacture, distribution, and management of vaccinations in 2022.

http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/07/bitcoin-vs-blockchain-debate/

So I’ve read Bailey’s article ( ) , watched Tim’s video ( ) , read this Nasdaq post ( ) , followed Richard’s every ( ) word ( ) , and even had my own good-spirited debate ( ) (see comments) with the Counterparty foundation’s Chris DeRose. So much hot air.
One thing Chris does well is boil it down to the question: is the blockchain an economic or a computer science innovation? The implication is that if blockchains are a purely economic innovation, there is no point to blockchains without cryptocurrencies. So let me state my position at the start:
I’m allowing “innovation” here to include a new combination of existing techniques , rather than something which has no precedent whatsoever. This definition allows the world wide web to be considered as an innovation, even though it did little more than combine hypertext with a twist on some existing Internet protocols. If you want to adopt a stricter definition of innovation, be my guest, but you’ll be surprised at how few true “innovations” remain. To paraphrase The Teacher ( ) , there is little new under the sun.
To be precise, I am making the claim that *blockchains without a token do serve a purpose* , but it’s a *different purpose* compared to the original bitcoin blockchain. Crypto-heads laugh at token-free blockchains because they can’t provide censorship resistance and decentralized security through proof-of-work. Fintech-heads laugh at public blockchains because they are slow, expensive and unsuitable for traditional finance. Well, keep laughing everybody, because I believe you are both right.
I’m going to argue that token-free blockchains are useful for keeping decentralized databases in sync, even in a single organization in which there is perfect trust. And then we’ll see what other features blockchains offer, which make them suitable for creating consensus for specific types of transactions between organizations, where there is only limited and imperfect trust.
Unfortunately, to follow the argument, you’re going to have to geek out with me on the bitcoin transactional model, database multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), and the problem of conflict resolution in multi-master database replication. I’ll do my best to stick to English but still, this is technical stuff, and there’s no avoiding it.
The bitcoin transactional model is simple but powerful. Every bitcoin transaction has a set of inputs and a set of outputs. Each input “spends” one output of a previous transaction. All of the bitcoin in a transaction’s inputs flow into that transaction and are distributed across its outputs according to the quantities written within. In this way, transactions form a multi-way connected chain which terminates at the “coinbase” transactions in which new bitcoins are created.
*If two transactions attempt to spend the same output, then only one of those transactions will ultimately be accepted. A blockchain acts as a unified mechanism to detect and prevent these conflicts across the network.*
We might like to use a democratic approach, in which nodes in the network vote on blocks, and the majority wins. Unfortunately, as any Internet poll can demonstrate, representative democracy is not possible online, because of the problem of impersonation (also known as a Sybil attack ( ) ). One person can take over a million computers and decide how they vote, thus seizing control of the network consensus. Nobody else will even know this has happened.
To solve this, bitcoin makes it deliberately difficult to add a block to the chain, via a process called “mining”. To create a block, you must solve a difficult but pointless mathematical problem that demands a lot of computation (and therefore electricity and money). You also need some luck, since you are in competition with many other block miners around the world. You can’t get ahead for long by buying a more powerful mining computer, because the network regularly adjusts the problem’s difficulty to keep a steady global rate of one block per 10 minutes.
If it’s so difficult and costly to create a block, why would anyone bother? The answer is in the block reward. The successful miner of a block controls the coinbase transaction that awards them 25 bitcoins (this sum halves every four years). They can sell these bitcoins on the open market for $7,000 (at today’s rate), pay off their electricity bill and hopefully pocket some profit. Miners also collect a little extra from fees that are attached to transactions, although for now these fees play a minor role.
So bitcoin generates consensus via proof-of-work and the crux of the bitcoin-heads’ argument is this: *Without a cryptocurrency, there is no way to incentivize decentralized mining of blocks.* Therefore there is no way to secure an open blockchain against impersonation attacks. Therefore anybody can monopolize the network consensus and render the whole thing useless. I won’t argue with any of that.
A database is a repository of structured information, grouped into spreadsheet-like entities called tables. A simple example of such a table is a list of bank accounts, in which each row contains an account number along with the balance of that account. Let’s say your account starts the day with a balance of $900. Today an automatic mortgage payment of $750 is scheduled and you also need to withdraw $400 from an ATM. Unfortunately you do not have an overdraft facility so one of these operations is set up to fail.
The processes for mortgage payments and ATM withdrawals run on separate systems, both of which access this single account database. Let’s say that each process works by reading your account’s balance, checking it is sufficient for the operation, initiating that operation, verifying the operation completes, calculating the new balance and then finally writing it into the database.
So long as your mortgage payment and ATM withdrawal don’t overlap, this logic will work fine. The first operation will execute successfully, and the second will abort because your account has insufficient funds. Depending on the order, you’ll get an angry phone call from the bank or a rude message on the ATM screen.
But what happens if the two processes happen to start at the same time? In this case, each will read your account’s balance and deem it sufficient to proceed. When the mortgage payment completes, your new balance will be calculated as $150 and written to the database. When the ATM withdrawal completes, your new balance of $500 will similarly be written. One of these write operations is going to override the other and, depending on your luck, you’ll receive a $750 or $400 bonus from your bank. No doubt you’ll soon learn to time your ATM visits for mortgage day.
Of course, this doesn’t happen in reality, because of a database technology called concurrency control ( ). Concurrency control keeps our data (especially financial) sane and secure, and it comes in many forms. But all share the principle that database operations are grouped into “transactions”, which are treated atomically, meaning that they succeed or fail as a whole. Concurrency preserves consistency by locking or freezing parts of a database while they are in use by one transaction, to prevent other transactions from operating on the same information in a conflicting way.
If we didn’t need to run transactions in parallel, we could lock the entire database for the entire duration of every single transaction. However this is not practical in most real-world applications. A good concurrency control scheme permits parallel operations by locking as little data as possible for as short a time as possible. In the example above, only the database row corresponding to your account would be locked, and only for the split second in which a final check and deduction took place. A conflicting transaction operating in parallel would simply have to wait until this lock is released.
One popular concurrency control technique is called multiversion concurrency control ( ) , or MVCC for short. In MVCC, each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data at a certain point in time, even if part of that data is in the process of being updated by a second simultaneous transaction. This snapshot isolation ( ) property ensures, for example, that a statement showing our total balance across several accounts will always be correct, even if some funds are in the process of moving from one account to another. One transaction will only affect the data seen by a second transaction if the second begins after all of the first’s changes have been successfully applied.
Behind the scenes, MVCC works by allowing multiple versions of a row to be maintained simultaneously, alongside a timestamp that represents each version’s date of last modification. Modifying a database row in MVCC marks the current version of that row for deletion, while applying the modification to a copy of that row with an updated timestamp. From the perspective of the database’s storage layer, there is no such thing as modifying a row in place. Each transaction knows exactly when it started, and only sees versions of rows whose timestamp predates that time. Old versions of rows can be removed from storage once there are no ongoing transactions which might need to access them.
*If two transactions attempt to delete the same row version, then only one of these transactions will ultimately be accepted. Multiversion concurrency control acts as a unified mechanism to detect and prevent these conflicts within a database.*
When it comes to reading data from databases, replication is an ideal technique, because all of the replicas contain the same information. However things get stickier when it comes to write operations, because we need to decide where those write operations are performed, and how they get transferred to other copies of the database.
The most common answer is to use master-slave replication, in which a single database (the “master”) is considered authoritative. Any changes to the data are performed exclusively on the master and then trickle down to all of the other “slave” databases via a transaction log. This keeps all the database copies (more or less) instantly in sync.
Unfortunately, if write operations are frequent, master-slave replication brings us right back to the problem that replication was designed to solve. The master database becomes a bottleneck in terms of reliability, throughput and latency, since every write operation is performed on it alone.
A more complex strategy is called multi-master replication, in which writes can be performed on any of the database copies, rather than on a single master. In this case, the copies share updates with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion in order to remain in sync.
This sounds simple in theory, but multi-master replication introduces a new problem because conflicts can arise. What if two copies of a database update the same row at the same time, then attempt to exchange these updates with each other? Both databases will notice that a conflicting update has taken place, and have to apply some agreed strategy for resolving these conflicts. And here things get pretty complex ( ) – see the docs for MySQL ( ) , SQL Server ( ) or Oracle ( ) for some examples of conflict resolution strategies. (I’m ignoring synchronous or so-called “eager” multi-master replication, in which all replicas must commit to a write operation before it can take place, because that turns every copy of the database into a bottleneck.)
If two transactions attempt to *spend* the same *output* , then only one of those transactions will ultimately be accepted. *A blockchain* acts as a unified mechanism to detect and prevent these conflicts *across the network*.
If two transactions attempt to *delete* the same *row version* , then only one of these transactions will ultimately be accepted. *Multiversion concurrency control* acts as a unified mechanism to detect and prevent these conflicts *within a database*.
Let’s flesh out the comparison a little further. From the perspective of a blockchain node, the current set of unspent bitcoin transaction outputs forms a database, in which each row is a single unspent output. This is similar to the database of bank accounts we described earlier, with the minor difference that the balance of each account can be split across multiple rows, each of which is marked with the same account number.
A bitcoin transaction spends one or more of these outputs and creates one or more new outputs as a result. This is exactly like a database transaction which deletes one or more row versions, and creates one or more new rows as a result (recall that in MVCC that there is no such thing as modifying a row in place). The bitcoin blockchain ensures that a single output cannot be spent by more than one transaction. This is equivalent to ensuring that a single row version cannot be deleted by more than one database transaction.
Now before we get carried away, I’m not claiming that blockchains are a great general purpose technology for distributed database synchronization in a fully trusted environment. There are plenty of other technologies such as Paxos ( ) , Raft ( ) and Two-phase commit ( ) which perform the job very nicely. But I do believe that blockchains have a sweet spot, which can be characterized as applications where:
All of these criteria are fulfilled by financial applications. The financial world is already used to delays (of up to 3 days!) between conducting a transaction and its final settlement. In terms of preventing conflicts, it has contracts and regulations in place to detect fraud, and the consequences can be severe. And the amount of data involved in each transaction is pretty small – think of the bank account example above.
So far, all I’ve demonstrated is that blockchains are yet another synchronization mechanism for distributed databases. Big wow. Things only get truly interesting when we consider the additional features that blockchains provide.
A bitcoin transaction does much more than just point to some previous transaction outputs and create some new ones in their place. Even the simplest bitcoin transaction serves two additional purposes.
First, the rules regarding valid transactions contain some of the application logic for our account database. Recall that the total quantity of bitcoin in a transaction’s inputs must cover the total quantity in the outputs. Translated into database application logic, this is a rule which states that database transactions (with the exception of coinbases) are not permitted to increase the total quantity of bitcoin in the database. This kind of constraint goes beyond regular database stored procedures ( ) because it cannot be circumvented under any circumstances.
Second, recall that each bitcoin transaction output encodes the conditions under which it can be spent. For regular bitcoin outputs, this condition is based on public key cryptography. A public address is embedded inside the output “script” so that it can only be spent using the private key corresponding to that public address. If we consider this output to be a database row, what we have is a database with per-row permissions which are based on public key cryptography. Furthermore, every transaction presents a publicly auditable proof that its creator(s) had the right to its prior rows. This (I believe) is a genuine novelty in database technology.
And again, it just so happens that both of these features are incredibly useful for financial applications. We like the fact that our database ensures, at the lowest possible level, that money cannot be created out of thin air. And we like having an incontrovertible audit trail demonstrating that every transaction was authorized by the holder of the funds which it moved. As discussed in detail here ( ) , we may also like performing safe atomic peer-to-peer exchange transactions (delivery-versus-payment in finance-talk), without even knowing the identity of our counterparty.
Of course, none of this is a coincidence, because bitcoin itself is a beautiful peer-to-peer financial application. Still, none of the above characteristics of a blockchain are dependent on the token at all. If we modify our “database” schema so that each row can represent multiple assets, rather than the blockchain’s native currency, then we can rid ourselves of that currency entirely. This leaves us with a blockchain as a way to achieve consensus and security in a peer-to-peer financial application for any class of asset.
Only one little question though: *Who does the mining to generate this consensus?* In bitcoin anonymous miners must perform expensive useless computations, and are incentivized to do so by the block rewards (and transaction fees) denominated in the blockchain’s native currency or token. Do we have any other options?
It turns out that we do. We can have a closed list of permitted miners, who identify themselves by signing the blocks that they create. Rules about distributed consensus (or “mining diversity” as we call it in MultiChain ( ) ) provide a different way of preventing minority control of the blockchain, *so long as you can accept that miners are pre-approved*. Of course for bitcoin this is not acceptable, because part of the point is to permit anonymous mining, so there is no way to censor transactions centrally. But if, say, we had a highly regulated financial system, in which bitcoin’s model was inapplicable, perhaps we could accept a pre-approved list of miners after all? If we had enough of them, and spread them well enough between institutions, and had legal contracts with all of them, are they really likely to gang up and undermine the network they depend on, when doing so will land them in jail?
My own personal view here is yes. Because they share a huge number of technical similarities, even while they differ in the permissions model and economic incentives. And most importantly, because they both generate consensus in a distributed database via a *chain of blocks*.
Well said, Gideon. A very balanced, well cited, well thought out article. Completely agree with your points. I’ve been arguing this for months that “The bitcoin blockchain was both an economic and a computer science innovation”.----




http://www.paymentssource.com/news/technology/a-very-public-confluct-over-private-blockchains-3021831-1.html

The word "blockchain" gets thrown around quite a bit as it's become a buzzword for the fintech and payments industry. But recently, Bitcoin theists have taken issue with associating blockchain to the private distributed ledger systems, such as Eris Industries and Hyperledger.
Instead, to this contingent, the blockchain refers to the public distributed ledger the Bitcoin protocol uses to record the growing list of bitcoin transaction data. The core concept for a digital cash system has been around for some time, but until the release of Bitcoin, many of these systems which relied on reputation suffered from Sybil attacks, where certain participants forge identities to subvert peer-to-peer systems.
Bitcoin's implementation is resistant from such attacks because it uses a proof of work algorithm where anonymous participants, called miners, that verify blocks must put forth a certain amount of computational processing power. Further incentive against harming the network or being deceptive, comes in the form of newly "issued" bitcoin that miners are rewarded when they verify a block using specialized computer hardware; plus individuals who invest tens of thousands of dollars into Bitcoin mining equipment are unlikely to try and destroy the network.
This distributed ledger concept has been privatized ( ) , although the companies that are developing these systems use a consensus algorithm instead of proof of work. These systems are controllable, repeatable, reversible and accountable, all features the financial services industry needs, harps Preston Byrne, chief operating officer and general counsel at Eris Industries.
Digital Asset Holdings, which launched in March headed by former JPMorgan Chase exec Blythe Masters, uses cryptocurrency technology to enhance the settlement and recording of financial assets. Masters is seen as a force to be reckoned with in the financial services industry and isn't taking bets on either cryptocurrency infrastructure play. Digital Asset Holdings acquired two companies ( ) in its few short months of existence: Bits of Proof, which built an enterprise-ready implementation of the Bitcoin protocol; and Hyperledger, which developed distributed ledger technology that allows financial institutions to run multiple private networks for managing assets.
The teams at Digital Asset Holdings and Hyperledger have a very similar approach to the market, O'Prey said. Both companies want a platform-agnostic system that targets financial institutions and is pragmatic about where the distributed ledger technology is useful (unlike the initial Bitcoin craze that sought to put everything on a blockchain), he said.
Bitcoin's censorship-resistant digital money model is well-suited for purposes such as funding a free press in countries where the government limits free speech. But it has also been used for illegal activities such as the purchase of drugs and weapons on black marketplaces, like Silk Road. These use cases aren't particularly appealing to the risk-averse financial services industry, which has been quick to pull support from controversial or legally questionable services ( ).
"So far, venture capitalists aren't funding [censorship resistant models]," said Tim Swanson, an industry pundit that is currently a researcher at SKBI in Singapore and advises Hyperledger and a number of other blockchain startups.
Instead VCs have thrown a remarkable amount of money at Bitcoin-based startups building "censored" or regulated services for allowing consumers, merchants and financial institutions to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. These include Coinbase, a Silicon Valley-based exchange, which has raised $105 million in venture capital since it's launch in 2012 and Circle Internet Financial, a consumer mobile wallet and merchant services platform, which has altogether raised $76 million.
"Private blockchain" companies haven't received funding close to the hundreds of millions of dollars raised by Bitcoin companies in the past few years, but the concept is still new. And many Bitcoin companies, such as Peernova ( ) hope to attract more VC interest by shifting their message to emphasize blockchain technology over specific uses of Bitcoin.
"The magic of any blockchain is that it allows someone to easily deploy an interactive application, on the public Internet, that runs itself automatically, predictably and without human supervision or dedicated hardware," Byrne said. "Secure data infrastructure that doesn't require physical infrastructure is the game-changer here. And it's going to be much, much bigger than just digital money."
Rather than duplicate the economic incentives that Bitcoin offers to miners, Eris' technology allows known validators to come to a consensus on the state of a ledger, while also allowing an overseer to handle exceptions, remove bad actors restore the ledger if it was falsified.
Traditionally, in database reconciliation, participants only have part of the copy of the global ledger, said Robert Sams, an industry pundit who writes at cryptonomics.org. With distributed consensus everyone comes to consensus on the global state of the ledger, said Sams, who  is also the founder and CEO of Clearmatics, which applies distributed consensus technology to the over-the-counter derivatives market.
"If you look at blockchain as using cryptographic signatures to link the ledger from one point to the next, then the concept of a private blockchain makes perfect sense," Sams said. "If you think the distinguishing feature of blockchain is the use of proof of work or proof or stake to solve for a Sybil attack, then it doesn't make sense."
Calling Ripple a blockchain company "is not technically correct but that's just the vernacular," said Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs, Inc. He likened the argument to Kleenex versus facial tissue. Kleenex, as a brand name, has become so prominent that many people use its name when referring to any brand of tissues.
Ripple doesn't require consensus nodes to carry the whole ledger of all transactions that ever happened. Instead, nodes only need to use the "last closed ledger" to come to agreement on the changes to the present ledger.
In May, the Nasdaq stock exchange announced plans ( ) to test Bitcoin's blockchain with its private markets platform, designed for firms planning initial public offerings (IPOs). Users will be able to link specific units of bitcoin to represent ownership and issue and transfer securities on the blockchain.
Blockstream, which builds sidechains that are pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, is Schuil's muse for the Barclays proposition. This could enable the use of a closed ledger system where users are verified and transact with each other and then moves to the Bitcoin blockchain to clear transactions.
This scheme could end up looking like Citigroup's new cryptocurrency, aptly named Citicoin, for cross-border payments. Banks could start deploying their own cryptocurrency networks, available only to their customers. These transactions would then be cleared over the Bitcoin network, which could lower costs ( ) for the banks and their customers, especially when dealing with international funds transfer.
The Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and CFPB — increasingly under the leadership of Democratic appointees — are gearing up to regulate cryptocurrency, modernize the Community Reinvestment Act and give consumers more control of their personal data. Here’s a look at the policy changes they’re mulling.
The Federal Reserve's capital guidance for S corporations is hindering some community development banks' access to the Treasury's $9 billion Emergency Capital Investment Program. The Fed has offered exemptions in the past, so why isn't it doing so now?
New England Federal Credit Union, the largest financial institution headquartered in the Green Mountain State, is combining with Vermont State Employees Credit Union to create an organization with $3 billion of assets.
Community lenders may choose to stop serving small businesses rather than absorb the expense of collecting information on race and ethnicity under a proposal by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Banks flush with liquidity are likely to keep deposit yields low even as the rates they earn on loans widen, which should result in higher net interest income. One industry analyst predicts “NII to the sky.”----




https://newscryp.to/how-to-earn-money-by-staking-cryptocurrency/

1. What is staking and how does it work? 2. What is the difference between Proof of Work and Staking? 3. Is staking safe? 4. How do I start staking my cryptocurrency? 5. Can a person lose money staking cryptocurrency? 6. How much can a person earn by staking cryptocurrency? 7. Which are the most popular Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies?
Staking is the process of securing a block in a blockchain network. A staker, or validator, puts up some amount of cryptocurrency as stake and gets rewarded for validating transactions on that network. If you’re interested in investing in crypto but don’t want to be bothered by having to manage your own wallet and private keys then staking might be the answer for you!
A staker places a security deposit, in the form of cryptocurrency, on a blockchain network. This amount is also called the stake. The security deposit serves as an incentive and insurance for the validators to validate transactions honestly and not try to fork off from the main chain. It also ensures all participants follow rules on the proof of stake network.
Proof of Stake eliminates the need for miners to payoff their power with expensive coins; Proof of Work is more democratic and inclusive but has been criticized as being unnecessarily wasteful. Proof of Work (POW) requires huge amounts of energy, and you know what that means? The miners can mine the coin! POW has your miner’s best interests in mind.
Staking is a form of mining for cryptocurrencies that don’t require as much energy to mine. Staking gives you the opportunity to earn rewards in your chosen cryptocurrency by holding coins on an online wallet. The more coins you stake, the greater chance you have of earning rewards while also helping secure the network and processing transactions. What are some things to consider before staking?
The first question that many people ask is “what are the risks?” The riskiest thing about staking a cryptocurrency is that you could lose access to your private key, which means you would lose all of your coins and tokens stored within it. If someone else gains control over your private key, they can also do anything with those funds that you would normally be able to do yourself as long as they have access to them.  Another risk associated with staking comes from hackers. Theft is one of the main real dangers to PoS.
There are various platforms that permit clients to begin staking coins. There are big names that most crypto-financial backers are likely acquainted with, including Coinbase and Kraken, which permit clients to stake coins.
Ambitious stakers could likewise take a look at “staking-as-a-administration” suppliers—which spend significant time in staking, as opposed to trading on MyContainer, Stake Capital, and Staked. Note that every one of these stages will have various contributions, rules, and charges.
It is possible, but not likely. The best way to make sure that you don’t lose any money while staking cryptocurrency is by doing your research and learning about the currency before investing in it. You should also learn about how proof-of-stake works so that you can understand why it’s a good idea to stake cryptocurrencies like NEO or Reddcoin instead of just holding onto them for long periods of time.
Don’t forget that there are other ways besides staking crypto coins where people can earn money with cryptocurrencies too! For example, some people choose to invest in ICOs instead because they believe those projects will be successful over the long term. There are lots of options when it comes to earning money with cryptocurrencies so feel free to explore all your options and see what works best for you.
Holding onto coins in your wallet as opposed to selling them off immediately after buying them from an exchange platform like Coinbase or Kraken allows users who hold their coins for long periods of time (we recommend at least 6 months) will receive rewards based on their holdings each month called “interest payments” or “staked returns.” These interest payments come from transaction fees paid by users sending transactions across blockchain networks, which gets redistributed among those who stake their coins within that network according to certain rules set forth by developers working on each project’s codebase.

https://schmitt-trading.com/are-cryptocurrencies-a-dream-come-true-for-cyber-extortionists/

When malicious software takes over computers around the world ( ) , encrypts their data ( ) and demands a ransom to decode the information, regular activities of governments ( ) , companies ( ) and hospitals ( ) slam to a halt. Sometimes security researchers release a fix that allows computer owners to decrypt their machines without paying ( ) , but many people are forced to pony up to free their data.
In 2016, the FBI estimated that the ransomware industry took in US$1 billion ( ) – and that’s only the cases officials know about ( ). All that money isn’t paid in cash. Before digital currencies existed, extortionists asked victims to send money by more formal transfer companies like Western Union or make deposits to bank accounts. Those were easily traced. Today, ransomware attacks demand payment in bitcoin and its ilk, systems praised by supporters for their transaction speed and protection of users’ anonymity ( ).
In researching cybercrime and cybersecurity for more than a decade, I have found that obtaining cybercrime proceeds is often the biggest challenge that cybercriminals face ( ). In this regard, diffusion of cryptocurrencies is a major development that enables cybercriminals to achieve their goals. In fact, the escalation of ransomware attacks and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies may be connected. Some companies have invested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies specifically so they can pay extortionists if it ever becomes necessary ( ). That helps contribute to the rapid growth in use and value of e-currencies. And as digital currencies become more common, ransomware attackers will have an easier time hiding their illicit transactions among the growing crowd of legitimate transfers.
The extortionists behind most ransomware attacks demand payments in bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. The WannaCry attackers demanded between $300 and $600 ( ) per computer; the Petya ransomware wanted $300 in bitcoins ( ) before providing a code that would let victims decrypt their data. Not many people actually pay, though: WannaCry victims paid only about $241,000 in bitcoins to the extortionists ( ). If everyone infected had paid, the criminals would have received at least $60 million. It translated to a payout rate of 0.4 percent. Even fewer paid the Petya perpetrators: They got just 66 payments ( ) , totaling barely over 4 bitcoins, or about $18,200.
Other attacks are more successful: In June, a ransomware attack hit more than 150 servers ( ) owned by South Korean web hosting firm Nayana. More than 3,400 of the company’s customers were affected – mostly small businesses running their websites on Nayana’s equipment. Nayana itself stepped up, taking loans to cover a payment of more than $1 million ( ) in bitcoins to the attackers, saying it had to save its clients’ sites ( ).
The attackers don’t always need to make much money to be effective. Many cybersecurity researchers believe that Petya attacks were carried out with political motives ( ) rather than for financial gains. But ransomware has a much higher payout rate than other common cybercrimes. One study found that for every 12.5 million spam emails sent promoting a fake online pharmacy, the scammers got only one response ( ). That’s a success rate of about 0.000008 percent. They make a lot of money – up to $3.5 million a year ( ) – only by sending out enormous numbers of messages.
One reason cybercrime success rates are low is that victims don’t trust the extortionists to actually unlock their data ( ) once they get paid. In 2016, about a quarter of the organizations that paid ransoms were not able to recover their data ( ).
The WannaCry attackers were particularly bad: Their system was labor-intensive, requiring the criminals to manually connect payments with encrypted files before letting victims decode them. In fact, a flaw in the WannaCry attack software ( ) made it almost impossible to decrypt a paying victim’s data.
More sophisticated methods do exist, including those that incorporate what are called “ smart contracts ( ) ,” another aspect of some cryptocurrency systems that runs a particular program as part of completing a transaction. In those ransomware attacks, making payment automatically releases the information ( ) a victim needs to decrypt and recover hijacked files.
The fear of ransomware is growing. In mid-2016, a study found that one-third of British firms ( ) had bought bitcoins just in case they needed to pay off ransomware attackers. More than 35 percent of large firms, those with more than 2,000 employees, reported being willing to pay as much as $65,000 ( ) to unlock critical files. Even Cornell University was reported ( ) to be stockpiling bitcoins ( ) in case of a future ransomware attack.
At the same time, bitcoin and other similar systems are becoming much more popular. In 2016, the total value of all cryptocurrencies was 0.025 percent of the world’s GDP ( ). By August 2017, that number had increased more than eight-fold, to 0.21 percent of global GDP – about $162 billion ( ). The World Economic Forum projects cryptocurrencies will hold 10 percent of global GDP by 2027 ( ).----




http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/

This article is about the possibility of Bitcoin-induced currency demonetization, or hyperbitcoinization , which is what would happen to any hapless currency that stands in Bitcoin's path of total world domination ( ). If this happens, the currency will rapidly lose value as Bitcoin supplants it. What would such an event be like and how can it be understood economically?
Demonetization refers to a process by which people cease to use a good as a currency, and hyperinflation is a kind of demonetization when the government inflates the currency at an accelerating pace. Hyperbitcoinization is a different kind, though it will appear (superficially) similar. In both kinds events, prices in the doomed currency will skyrocket until it is no longer a currency at all.
There are two essential differences between hyperinflation and hyperbitcoinization. The first is that a currency hyperinflates with restricted competition from other currencies, whereas hyperbitcoinization happens because of competition with Bitcoin. This is because capital controls are much more effective on other fiat currencies than on Bitcoin, so it is easy for Bitcoin to cross borders and compete with anything.
The second is that in a hyperinflation, the government expands the money supply to outpace people's inflation expectations. Demonetization occurs as a result of their destructive interaction. Whereas a hyperbitcoinization event need not be accompanied by any change in the supply of either currency.
As the government forms a habit of inflating the money supply, its people form a habit of anticipating rising prices. This prevents the government from gaining as much each time it inflates. Thus, to get the same kick, the government must inflate more. The money loses value once people anticipate such heavy inflation that they can't spend it fast enough and it no longer functions as a currency.
Hyperinflation is an entrepreneurial act on the part of government, in the sense that it involves a continually changing intervention that prevents an equilibrium from forming. The government must continually alter its own behavior to stay ahead of its people's. The moment they begin to anticipate its future policy, the government must change the policy by increasing the rate of inflation.
Hyperbitcoinization is a voluntary transition from an inferior currency to a superior one, and its adoption is a series of individual acts of entrepreneurship rather than a single monopolist that games the system.
A hyperbitcoinization event will be much quicker than a hyperinflation event. I have two reasons for this. First, the government will have a much greater difficulty preventing bitcoins from entering the country due to the impotency of capital controls upon it. Second, hyperinflation is inherently an attempt to fool people, whereas hyperbitcoinization is quite regular and predictable (at least by comparison). Therefore people will more easily see that they had better switch over. Thus, as fast as hyperinflation is, hyperbitcoinization will be even faster. It will happen much faster than you expect ( ).
Hyperbitcoinization will not disrupt the economy to nearly the same degree as hyperinflation. The currency is the instrument of the division of labor, and hyperinflation makes it unreliable and forces people to use worse alternatives. In a hyperbitcoinization event, people switch from a fundamentally inferior currency to a superior one, whereas in a hyperinflationary event people will only switch to a new currency once the old currency becomes worse than the next best alternative, such as gold or detergent. Hyperbitcoinization should be accompanied by a rapid improvement in productivity and wealth.----




http://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-and-overstock-to-create-decentralized-stock-exchange/

Today, in a keynote address at Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne announced a partnership with Counterparty on a project code-named Medici, a front-end and portal to the decentralized stock exchange of the Counterparty platform. Our shared goal is to build a cutting-edge stock market on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and help Bitcoin do for Wall Street what it has already begun to do for payments.
This endeavor is already in motion and moving quickly. Both Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner have relocated to Utah to work on Medici, while Adam Krellenstein will continue working full-time on the Counterparty protocol itself. The Counterparty project is continuing to grow very rapidly, hiring ( ) new developers and building out new projects within the ecosystem, such as Medici itself.
Our partnership with Overstock marks a major milestone in the history of Counterparty, which has emerged as the preeminent Bitcoin 2.0 platform and the future of cryptosecurities technology. We thank our community for its generous support, are honored to have Overstock.com and Patrick Byrne as partners, and are eager to take the next steps together toward the creation of a free, democratic, and global marketplace.----




https://devcon.ethereum.org/

We started last year by saying that Devcon is all about collaboration, knowledge sharing, and understanding the cutting edge in the Ethereum space. Over the last months, much of this work has been done online. And while we still plan to use our biggest stage to send a message about what Ethereum has accomplished (and to make use of tools built by our community while working to grow the Ethereum ecosystem), in the meantime we’ve been laying the groundwork for the event and its future so that we’re ready when the world is ready for us too.
Now, we’d like to find new ways to welcome old friends back, and new friends into the fold. And as the drumbeat starts to get a little louder with the first reunions not too far away, we’ll do what we can to highlight leading ecosystem events, whether regional, virtual, or locally accessible meetups.

http://dailyanarchist.com/2014/02/24/the-tsa-is-looking-for-bitcoin/

It seems like every time I fly I have an interesting interaction with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). I make it a point to always opt out, and if possible always strike up a conversation with the man molesting me. But yesterday was by far the most frightening, as well as cautionary for Bitcoin users. I’m going to begin simply by relaying the facts as observed, including some that will seem insignificant at first. Then I will provide some analysis, as well as speculation what’s going on here. What’s absolutely clear is that the TSA is looking for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin users need to be conscious when they travel, especially internationally.
I was flying out of Manchester, on my way home from the New Hampshire Liberty Forum. By coincidence I ran into Bill Buppert from ZeroGov.com ( ) and his wife while checking my luggage. And we happened to be taking the same flight. I met Bill last week at the Freedom Summit in Arizona, spent time with him again at Liberty Forum, and we have become fast friends. Without his help, I’m not sure what would have happened to me.
I was wearing my Bitcoin Not Bombs ( ) hoodie which features an image of a B17 bomber dropping Bitcoin from its bomb bay doors. The sweatshirt does not feature the words “Bitcoin Not Bombs” only the image.
We approached the TSA screening and began to put our things in the gray bins. My things required two bins. One for my backpack and shoes, and the other for my laptop and phone. I asked the greeting officer to point me to the opt-out line. Bill immediately told the agent that he would also like to opt-out, and he thanked me for making that choice.
Bill went first, but I was told to stand right beside him. Bill’s strategy is very simple, and effective. He plainly told the officer, “I understand, but please don’t touch my dick.” This immediately perturbed the agent, a man named Tinker, which was the only name badge I saw clearly. Tinker immediately called over a superior officer.
Bill continued to converse with Tinker, however I could not make out the conversation as my pat down had begun. His name began with a Y, and looked Russian in origin, but I cannot say with certainty what it was. Y asked me to identify my property in the gray bins, then he placed it right in front of me and asked me to keep an eye on it for my own peace of mind. He emphasized watching my property three times, which they don’t usually do. I appreciate that, but I didn’t say so. I try to say as little as possible.
A moment later a plump female agent told me she had to pull my backpack aside for further inspection. She asked if I would like to be present for that inspection. I said, “If I have a choice, of course I would like to be present when you search my belongings.” She replied “Of course you have a choice” which struck me as odd, since I had virtually no choices during most of my molestation. She picked up my backpack and began to leave with it.
I protested. “Wait! The other agent instructed me to keep an eye on my property. How can I do that if you put it in two different places?” The choices ended there. She informed me that she would watch my backpack while I was patted down, and I could watch her inspect it when Y was finished.
Y began to give me the standards speech he is required to give by law. I said I didn’t want a private screening, to which he responded, “If you are uncomfortable in any way, at any time we can stop and move to a private screening.” Apparently being made uncomfortable in private is somehow better.
When he explained that he was going to put his hands on my inner leg and move upward toward my torso until he “met resistance” I said, “If that’s all it takes I’m ready to resist now.” He paused, but only repeated the line finishing with “Believe me, I am as uncomfortable with this as you are.” That was my hook. I always prefer an appeal to humanity over an appeal to law. When an agent reveals something human about himself that is the area I like to explore. Y was uncomfortable. So, I asked him why he was uncomfortable. He said, “Why would anyone be comfortable doing this?” I replied, “I just find it interesting. I’ve never heard an agent say that before.” He said, “Well, we’re not all part of the security club around here.” The term struck me as strange, “the security club.”
He continued for a bit. Putting his hands in my pants and cupping my butt. Then I asked, “Did you work here before they implemented this policy?” He said no, that he had only been there a short time. He had been training to become a pilot, but that the government sequester meant that this was the only job available to him in aviation. He hoped to get out as soon as he found another opening. I wish I could remember this part of the conversation more specifically, but the names of the licenses and agencies that contributed to him being stuck in this job went by very quickly. The next thing I clearly remember is him saying, “There are a lot of us who are not on the security track. There’s a girl here waiting to be chemist.” Another interesting term, “the security track.”
I decided not give him any more flak. I thanked him for sharing with me, and wished him the best of luck becoming a pilot. He responded by wishing me luck in whatever my pursuits were, and after checking the swabs for chemical explosives, he cleared me for my enhanced backpack inspection.
The plump woman was very nice. She explained that there was a lot of metal in my bag and she needed to confirm what it was. I was carrying a few hundred metal lapel pins from ShinyBadges.com that I’d been selling at the conference. She began to remove my inventory, which was stored in clear plastic tubes each containing about 50 pins. 5 tubes in all, plus a blue display case with about another 50 pins. The pins were clearly visible without opening these cases with the exception of one. I had an opaque white plastic container which held about 100 pins. I had used it to deliver custom pins to Mandrik from Blockchain.info ( ) , and he returned it when he was finished. It had the Blockchain “B” logo drawn on the outside, which is similar to the common Bitcoin “B” logo, but not the same. I had no visible Bitcoin pins anywhere in my inventory. I sold out of them at the conference, and had only a small quantity of Blockchain pins in the opaque container. I also had no Bitcoin related flyers in my bag. I had given them all to other activists to bring home to their Bitcoin meetups.
The plump agent put all my containers in a separate gray bin to be screened again. She asked “Do you have any coins in these?” I replied, “No, why?” and she answered, “I just want to make sure you don’t have anything valuable.” Actually,” I replied “those are all valuable to me.”
She took both the bin with my backpack, and the bin with my inventory back to the front of the TSA screening area. I attempted to follow her, but was quickly cut off another male agent with a large imposing figure. “You can’t go that way. Stay here.” I protested, “The other agent instructed me to keep an eye on my property.” The plump woman continued out of sight and large agent told me I could stand in the area where people were putting their shoes back on. I could not see my property from there.
Bill and his wife were sitting on a bench in the terminal waiting for me as I approached them. Then two men stepped between us, both wearing dress shirts, one orange and one blue. The orange shirt asked where I was traveling to. I replied “Earth.” This was not intended to be antagonistic. I usually reply that way when asked where I am from. It’s a product of my love for science fiction. He asked me to be more specific and I said, “The Northern part.” Admittedly snarky, but still not malicious. I didn’t know who these men were. I had already been cleared by security, and based on their attire and their forwardness I thought they might be other attendees of the conference on their way home. I was joking with them, like I do with most equals.
Full stop. State speech is hate speech. I then noticed their name badges, but I didn’t have the forethought to commit them to memory. I responded, “Are you conducting some kind of an investigation, or do you have reason to suspect me of something?”
They identified themselves as “managers” and the orange shirt said he was obligated to inquire whether or not I was traveling internationally, which was not an answer to my question. I replied, “Am I obligated to answer your questions?” He replied, “If you are traveling internationally you are.” I replied, “Do you have any reason to suspect that I’m traveling internationally?” The orange shirt said “We’re the ones asking the questions here” and the the blue shirt asked to search my bag for my boarding pass. I told him that my bag was already inspected and didn’t contain anything dangerous, and that I didn’t consent to another search. He said until I was cleared by security he was free to search. I said I was cleared by security.
I was about to ask for my attorney, who happens to be my wife, when the orange shirt said, “What about Bitcoin?” I was flabbergasted. This was above and beyond any scrutiny I had ever received from the TSA, and a little frightening that they were looking for Bitcoin. I said I didn’t understand the question. He continued, “We saw Bitcoin in your bag and need to check.” I was incredulous, and asked, “Do you have a superior officer because I don’t think you know what you’re talking about.” The blue shirt replied by repeating that they were “managers,” but if I didn’t answer his questions he could call law enforcement and have me taken into custody. I asked, “Aren’t you law enforcement?” and he replied, “No we’re with the TSA.”
I turned back to the orange shirt and asked “What did the Bitcoin look like?” Bill chimed in and told the agent that what he was saying was impossible because Bitcoin is digital and doesn’t have have any physical manifestation. You can’t “see” Bitcoin. The orange shirt said they looked like medallions or tokens. I said I didn’t understand what he was talking about, and he simply repeated, in a child like way, that Bitcoins are like metal tokens. I told him that I didn’t have any tokens.
At this point I was beginning to panic and looking for a way out. Then the orange shirt said they needed to determine whether or not I was carrying more than $10,000, to which I asked how much cash he suspected I was carrying. I had about $300 in my wallet, 1.2 oz of silver in my pocket, and 4.20 Bitcoin accessible from, but not actually on my phone. I told them none of this. The orange shirt replied, “It depends how much Bitcoin you have.” I asked him what he thought a Bitcoin was worth, and he replied, “It fluctuates all the time.”
I was out of ideas. At that point I was certain I didn’t want to say another word. I thought they were ready to concoct some kind of money laundering charge. I began running scenarios in my head where I refused to unlock my phone for fear that they would construe my 4.20 Bitcoin as somehow worth more than $10,000. That’s when the blue shirt turned to Bill and his wife. He asked them if I was traveling internationally, to which Bill’s wife replied, “Not that I know of.” Then they turned and disappeared just as quickly as they had appeared.
I was shaking, and grateful that Bill and his wife were there, even just to bear witness. There were also other attendees from Liberty Forum in the terminal who came to observe, including one wearing a Bitcoin Not Bombs t-shirt. Once we reached our gate, and I calmed down, I began an audio recording ( ) as Bill and I recounted the events as best we could remember. During that time the orange shirt walked by appearing to be looking for me, Tinker, the agent who patted down Bill, was stationed away from the TSA screening area and was clearly keeping an eye on me, and two police officers with black flak jackets and sidearms were hovering around the gate until we boarded.
There is so much to say about this encounter. It really was a kind of perfect storm. If I wasn’t wearing the hoodie it probably wouldn’t have happened. If I wasn’t carrying my Shiny Badges inventory it probably wouldn’t have happened. And if I wasn’t such a snarky sci-fi geek it probably wouldn’t have happened. But all these things came together to reveal something spooky about TSA policy.
Briefly, with regard to the pat downs, it’s interesting that Tinker would call an superior in response to Bill, when he knew full well that his procedure would not change, and could not change. I suspect he was seeking an authority figure to absolve him of responsibility, as the Milgram experiment ( ) suggests. It’s also interesting that Y would suggest that agents within the TSA are factionalized. A “security club” of people on the “security track” who are distinct from those eagerly seeking other work, because they are uncomfortable molesting people.
Things really began getting weird when the plump agent asked if I had any coins. It seemed innocuous at the time, because I’m accustomed to TSA agents asking me to empty coins out of my pockets, but this was different. The baggage x-ray machines aren’t intended to detect coins, and US coins aren’t terribly valuable anyway. If she was looking for valuables “coin” is a strange word to use. The word “coin” is very tricky in legal tender land. I learned from the Liberty Dollar case that the word “coin” holds some kind of special magic in the eyes of the State, and to avoid running afoul of legal tender laws silver rounds should be referred to as “tokens” or “medallions.” Interesting too that those are the exact words the agent in the orange shirt used. Also “coin” has become the emerging standards for all crypto-currency. To a diabolical mind, this could be quite an entrapping question. In the future I won’t be answering it.
I gave the worst possible answer, no coins, but still very valuable. My thinking at the time was that everything I own is too valuable to be molested by a bureaucrat. Why would I carry something that wasn’t valuable to me? Value is, after all, subjective. In hindsight I should have said nothing. My standard position of saying nothing to a bureaucrat I don’t have to had been compromised by my desire for theater in the screening process. This was foolish. This question of hers, “Do you have any coins” was, in my opinion, a carefully crafted gotcha question, and not the idle banter it seemed at the time. I had forgotten the central tenet that everything a bureaucrat does or says is against you. Every question you answer is a weapon against you. I should have said nothing.
Telling them that I was not traveling internationally was the way out, although I didn’t know that at the time. At least for now this $10,000 limit only applies to international travel. Once they realized I was not traveling internationally they lost all legal basis to continue their investigation, but they clearly still regarded me as a criminal. Otherwise, why would they continue to monitor me? They were searching for another legal basis to harass me.
Here’s what I think happened from their perspective. Obviously, the TSA has been trained, although poorly, to look for Bitcoin. They are apparently now trying to catch money launderers in addition to terrorists, and large tubes of tooth paste. My hoodie is probably what caught their attention, and everything after that received extra attention. When they saw all the metal lapel pins in my bag they probably thought they hit the jackpot on a stockpile of Casascius coins. Whatever training they had it probably included that stock photo of brass tokens everyone uses. My evasiveness only quickened their blood lust, as they imagined a big bust, and possibly a promotion down the security track.
It was an open faced lie when they said they “saw” Bitcoins in my bag. Always remember bureaucrats can legally lie to you, but lying to them, even by mistake is a serious crime they’ll use as leverage to coerce further cooperation. They didn’t inquire about my phone, or my laptop, or my USB drive, which makes me think their Bitcoin training wasn’t very good, or that these particular bureaucrats didn’t pay very close attention. But, if the TSA is going to be looking for Bitcoin, they can use that pretense to search any person, at any time, to any degree. It’s entirely possible that a traveler could be carrying thousands of Casascius coins which are not loaded, and worth little more their value in brass. It’s also possible that a traveler could be carrying one Casascius coin that has been loaded with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Technologically speaking the private key to a Bitcoin wallet could be embedded in virtually any object, including the brain of the traveler. It could be argued, in fact I would, that the Bitcoin is already on both sides of the check point, and carrying any kind of physical wallet is no different from carrying a debit card, or a pin number. It would even be possible for a traveler outside the TSA screening area to send any amount of bitcoin directly to a traveler already inside the terminal, and there’s nothing the TSA can do to prevent that.
In the end it’s important for Bitcoin users to be aware of these Stasi tactics being used by the TSA. Maybe some Bitcoin users want to confront it directly with some kind of civil disobedience or demonstration. Maybe others will want to take extra steps to ensure they don’t face this added scrutiny. But this is what FINCEN meant when they said that Bitcoin could be regulated under existing law. They meant that the policy toward Bitcoin will be decided in secret, outside the legislature, by law enforcement bureaucrats reinterpreting old laws in new ways, to be enforced arbitrarily and inconsistently to evoke to greatest degree of doubt, confusion, and alarm.
People need to know, you can’t fight the system while you’re in the hands of such people – if you’re entangled just try to get out and then combat abuse from a safe position. It feels like cowing down and being submissive, but you’re the winner if you get out of it. There are always going to be authoritarian bullies in these fields. Your best option is to take away any justification for an escalation by appearing to comply, and then hand them their asses later. You have the right to stay out of jail.
I’m sick and tired of all these people complaining about these TSA people and their procedures. I quit flying in 2002 before they even started this pat down shit. This underwear bomber dude was CIA. Now you don’t even hear many people complain. If you fly but don’t have to, then please shut up and just let them do what they want. You are being radiated at the airport. The radiation from Fukushima in the atmosphere will radiate the fuck out of you. It depends on where it is at any given time. But please quit complaining this shit was designed for you sheeple.
I saw online this ex-CIA agent said when there is an emergency cops are good to have around, but when other than that they only want to put you in jail. He said that should make the hair on your neck stand up. Their only purpose is to arrest you and they love to do it. I avoid cops at all costs.
You have no right to travel on an airplane. please show me in the constitution where it says you have the freedom to travel ‘on an airplane” you surrender your rights to things by taking actions all the time. Yelling fire or bomb in a theatre is not free speach. Rioting is not freedom of assembly. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TRAVEL ON A PLANE. IF YOU WANT TO TRAVEL ON A PLANE YOU ARE SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF THE BODY THAT GOVERNS THAT FORM OF TRANSPORT> YOU WERE NOT VIOLATED> YOU WERE SEACHED> Dont like it? DONT FLY> Buy your own plane. I have the RIGHT to be kept safe from people trying to kill me by attacking a plane. You do NOT have a right to subject me to danger simply because you dont want to get searched.
The Jews have blown up all the planes the last forty years. None of them by Arabs. All these underwear and shoebombers were just CIA created and now look at what you have to go through each day. I mean seriously an underwear bomber? I thought by now we would have had a anus bomber and you know by now you would be getting anus probes. You sheeple seem to be enduring these molestations at the airport and now have settled into the daily groping like it is no big deal. Have they caught anyone taking explosives onboard?
They keep piling on the crap. Remember when you could freely drive and you decide if you wanted to wear a seatbelt or not? I would not fly on a plane in this day and time unless it was an emergency. If I wanted to go to Europe I would take a ship. It is not worth going through this crap.
You should consult an attorney about a civil suit. The TSA’s mandate to protect air travel does not extend towards general warrantless searches for fishing expeditions related to something that might or might not be a crime.
Unfortunately, you probably don’t have much of a case because you weren’t arrested. Although still wrong, this type of intrusiveness has become somewhat the norm in our society. Your story does demonstrate how ignorant TSA is when when it comes to some topics such as BitCoin.
Stone – you need to get your head checked. You don’t check-in your rights when you check-in your baggage. If he was cleared from being a security threat (which he was), that should have been the end of it. After all, isn’t that the whole reasoning behind your argument — to ensure TSA is keeping the skies safe? And to Jeff’s point, there’s not a mandated “right” or government requirement for anyone else to keep you safe. Furthermore, having your own aircraft isn’t the solution – there’s been several recent and more severe incidents where GA aircraft have been detained and searched at GUNPOINT by Dept of Homeland Security without valid reason. In reality, they were just fishing expeditions that came up empty (oh btw, coming from a pilot and aircraft owner)
Unfortunately, we live in a world where we need TSA. It sometimes can be a double-edge sword. Just remember, although they have “Officer” on their badges, they lack any authority to arrest. Arrests must be done by a police officer or someone who has specifically been given that authority by the State or Federal government. If you should ever feel TSA is overstepping their boundaries, feel free to ask for a police officer. With that said, make sure you’re clean, otherwise you could end up in cuffs 🙂----

A custodial crypto wallet let’s you hold, send, receive and in some cases also invest your crypto assets. However, you are not in full control over your funds. Instead, you trust the wallet provider to “custody” your funds for you. Custodial wallets are convenient and good for beginners.
Custodial wallets are like banks. They are provided by a centralized entity who controls your assets and saves them for you. If you want to move funds out of your custodial wallet you need to request a withdrawal. Importantly, with a custodial wallet you can’t access decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain.
Non-custodial wallets allow you to keep complete ownership of your funds. Holding crypto assets in a non-custodial wallet is the equivalent of holding cash in the real world. Your funds are stored on the Blockchain and you have direct control over them. Most wallets allow you to hold, send & receive funds on multiple blockchains.
The business models of custodial wallet providers differ. Most make money when you trade one crypto asset for another or buy a crypto asset using fiat currency. Many also offer add-on services like crypto cards allowing you to spend your crypto in stores or to lend your crypto assets and earn interest on it.
Custodial wallets offer their services in a limited number of countries. Because custodial wallets hold your funds in custody and handle fiat payments they are subjected to regulation (unlike non-custodial wallets ( ) ). This means they can only operate in whichever country they hold licenses. Search for a wallet that operates in your country.
When it comes down to choosing a good custodial wallet look at two things: a) reputation b) fees. Good reputation matters because it means the company has a track record of doing things right, no hacks, good customer support etc. Fees matter as well.----




https://content.etoro.com/lp/bitcoin/

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency in the world, launched in 2009. It is also the first wide-scale, real-world application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralised network which uses a public ledger to approve transactions, eliminating the need for third party approval (such as a bank). It also operates free of a governing body, such as a central bank, and all changes in the network require consensus from its members. While initially BTC value was extremely low, priced at fractions of cents, it picked up steam over the years, reaching price levels in the thousands of dollars for a single Bitcoin token and a market cap in the hundreds of billions.
The Bitcoin chart often displays extreme volatility, having short-term price spikes and tumbles. Sometimes, when the Bitcoin price is on the rise, more people are inclined to buy Bitcoin ( ) , fueling its positive run further. On the other hand, when the Bitcoin value is on the decline, it can prompt existing investors to sell their Bitcoin and push prices down. Moreover, Bitcoin is considered the bellwether of the cryptocurrency space, so it can often generate industry-wide trends.
Long-term investors: While still considered an extremely volatile and risky market, Bitcoin has shown tremendous price increases over time. Therefore, those who believe the overall trend will be positive could consider a Bitcoin investment.
Blockchain enthusiasts: Since Bitcoin is the first major application of blockchain technology, those who have faith in the technology and its potential impact on the tech and financial industries, could consider buying Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a highly volatile instrument that has experienced tremendous price movements over the years, sometimes gaining hundreds of percentage points or crashing significantly over a relatively short period of time. While it is less affected by happenings in mainstream markets, it can be affected by a variety of factors relating to the crypto space, the blockchain industry and by regulatory issues. Here are a few examples:
General crypto trends: In late 2017, cryptocurrencies were heavily debated in the media. People, who previously hadn’t heard of the crypto, started asking how to buy Bitcoin. This sparked a massive crypto bull run, which peaked in December of 2017 when nearly all the major cryptos reached record highs.
Mainstream market volatility: Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry operate separately from other markets. Therefore, when mainstream markets are on the decline or become too volatile, some traders and investors turn to the crypto market as an alternative.
Traditional financial institutions: Over the years, there have been several attempts to introduce Bitcoin into mainstream markets in the form of ETFs, futures contracts and other financial instruments. Since many of these instruments require regulatory approval, traditional regulatory bodies, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could have a major impact on the market, whether they approve or deny such instruments.
The blockchain industry: Some experts believe that blockchain has the potential to revolutionise many areas of the technology and financial industries. Bitcoin is the first and one of the largest blockchain networks in the world, and as the technology becomes more widespread, more people might be inclined to buy BTC.
The way Bitcoin works as a decentralised network relies on its members, some of which are miners. Miners allocate computing power to carry out transactions and are rewarded a small fee for each transaction. Since these processes require computing power and electricity, Bitcoin miners are usually those who invested significant sums of money to build mining computers.
However, miners have another key role. When the Bitcoin blockchain network needs to undergo a change or an upgrade, it needs the approval of its members, which can signal whether or not they approve the change. If the change is significant and makes the platform backward compatible, it is known as a hard fork. When not enough participants approve the change, a hard fork results in a parallel blockchain network being created.
Such was the case with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in August 2017. With this hard fork, a group of developers intentionally rolled out a protocol they knew would be rejected by some members of the network, hence creating a hard fork and a new cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash became incredibly successful, reaching a market cap in the billions and becoming a top 5 crypto.
Bitcoin was founded in 2008 and launched the next year by an unknown person or persons using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. While initially it was only adopted by blockchain enthusiasts, the fact that it enabled users to carry out transactions quickly and while maintaining their anonymity, made its popularity grow exponentially over time. The first purchase of physical goods using Bitcoin ever made was 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, in 2010. The same pizzas would be worth $190,000,000 in January 2018.
As Bitcoin became more popular, numerous other cryptocurrencies were created. Some were built on the same technology, while others created blockchain protocols of their own. However, despite growing competition in the crypto space, Bitcoin has maintained its place as the world’s largest crypto by market cap for many years.
Much has happened in the crypto industry since Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency in the world. Growing rapidly in number, there are thousands of cryptos today, many with significant market caps and trading volumes. However, Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the industry, if only due to its sheer, massive size. As the industry progresses and diversifies, there is a possibility Bitcoin will lose its place as the largest crypto. However, such a scenario seems very unlikely in the near future, and Bitcoin could very well maintain its spot as the world’s top crypto for years to come.

In 2017, through our communication with Scaling Bitcoin ( ) sponsors and event participants about what problems they are experiencing that Scaling Bitcoin should focus on, we have received one message repeatedly - "Lack of talent". Organizations that want to participate in and integrate with the Bitcoin ecosystem face great difficulty recruiting developers with relevant expertise.
We launched a new initiative called "Bitcoin Edge" to address this talent deficit. This initiative ran for the first time in Silicon Valley as the Tutorial Track called "Dev++" alongside of the Scaling Bitcoin 2017 "Scaling the Edge". The second installment of Dev++ ran in 2018 at Keio University alongside of the Scaling Bitcoin 2018 "Kaizen". The third installment is taking place at the Tel Aviv University September 2019 alongside of the Scaling Bitcoin 2019 "Yesod".
*Bitcoin Edge Dev++* Tutorial is meant to focus on scaling the development capacity of the ecosystem via education of developers in the field of cryptocurrency and helping the industry streamline the process of developer training. The primary focus of this tutorial is the basic first-principles introduction to cryptocurrency and cryptography as well as cryptocurrency-specific engineering methodologies, security practices, and standard operating procedures.
In 2019, Financial Stability Board (FSB) report produced on the subject of Crypto-Assets and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) has been references in the G20 Communique issued during the G20 Finance and Central Bank meeting in Fukuoka, Japan. To help gather much needed feedback on regulatory topics from the industry participants, we are running a *Decentralized Financial Architecture - Workshop for Multistakeholders ** ( ) - DFA-2019 ( )**----

https://blog.applovin.com/crypto-blockchain-powered-programmatic-ads/

To wrap up the series, I’d like to lay out one argument to consider when asking why blockchain and cryptocurrency will or will not evolve to become a successful and disruptive force in programmatic advertising: computing is becoming more decentralized, and blockchain (the underlying tech behind cryptocurrency) is, too. Although using blockchain for programmatic advertising has yet to be proven, it has the potential to reshape the programmatic advertising industry.
Let’s start by defining decentralization, and unpacking the factors that make a decentralized, blockchain-style approach to computing attractive to many in the mobile ecosystem, including users, developers, and brands.
In computing, decentralization means moving computing resources off a central server and instead storing and managing data across a network of user-controlled computers that run independently of each other. The core effects are a reduction in latency, more efficient data transfer, and greater overall resilience (i.e. no single fail point) vs. centralized computing systems.
The underlying technology of decentralization consists of a distributed database constructed of data blocks that contain timestamps and link to a previous block, making it an ideal technology on which to build and run a P2P system for transactions and exchange (like a programmatic ad market). These are market-shaping deviations from the way traditional centralized platforms work and monetize.
When centralized platforms are young, they are eager to attract developers, users, and marketers. But this relationship changes for the worse as centralized platforms grow. As investor Chris Dixon wrote in his Medium post, “Why decentralization matters ( ) “ :
“When they hit the top of the S-curve ( ) , their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs Netscape, Facebook vs Zynga, and Twitter vs its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better (but) still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.”
Developers and investors are tired of wrestling over data control, and they’re frustrated from dealing with the ramifications of security breaches over which they have no control, so it makes sense that they see decentralized computing as a green pasture ( ).
Blockchain, of course, uses this decentralized approach as the basis for how data is stored, accessed, updated, and shared. Cryptocurrency is the example we’ll focus on here, but there are also active use cases for decentralized platform approaches in cyber security, supply chain management, insurance, healthcare, energy management, and many other industries ( ).
As pervasive as the programmatic advertising discussion can seem to us in the mobile space, you can’t overstate the opportunity that lies ahead. We’ve only recently hit the tipping point where mobile ad spend has surpassed desktop ( ).
That’s not changing, but there will be a few more rows on the spreadsheet soon: programmatic ad budget for voice-activated assistants, programmatic ad budget for dynamic insertions into podcasts, programmatic ad budget for in-app video AR ads, and so on.
These growing channels will be one future outcome of evolving programmatic ad markets, and they’ll be fueled by evolutions in a variety of other technologies, like larger and better connected data sets, rapid iterations in AI and machine learning, and, with an excellent sense of timing, cryptocurrency.
MadHive ( ) , EnvisionX ( ) , and Ternio ( ) are a few early entrants that are finding ways to create and incentivize cyrptocurrency-based programmatic ad markets, but there are more to come. Kochava, an attribution and marketing analytics platform, is also planning to launch its blockchain digital advertising platform XCHNG ( ) in early 2018 to increase transparency between buyers and sellers of ads.
With publishers and advertisers seeking to increase margins and simplify the buying and selling process, the freedom offered by blockchain methods could dovetail nicely with the broader evolution of programmatic ads.
Cryptocurrency is digital and pricing is transparent, so both the buy and sell sides of the sometimes confusing programmatic ad market stand to benefit from crypto-powered markets. Settlement for cryptocurrency transactions is also real time—a huge plus for cash-strapped developers. There are also (for now) fewer parties between buyers and sellers in the cryptocurrency programmatic market, meaning everyone’s take can be a little bigger.
However, big questions remain, like when will cryptocurrency-powered transactions go mainstream? What are the long term impacts on CPM, cost of acquisition, average revenue per user, and the other things app publishers and brands collectively care about? These are big questions, but the market’s need to answer them will not restrain the greater need to start delivering crypto-powered experiences. In other words, we’ll show our math later, but we need to build right now.
Decentralized platform computing technology offers developers a new playground as well as a new set of challenges. In parallel, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are finding new applications in a variety of markets, recreating the way apps are financed and monetized, and changing how programmatic ad revenue is divided.----

MadHive -- which develops blockchain technology for media and advertising, along with The Mad Foundation -- will generate the sale of "Mad tokens," a cryptocurrency to support an open blockchain network for the advertising industry.
The network’s machine-learning strategy will initially focus on connected TV ad inventory and eventually will move to linear television, beginning with regional and local, and then add other online media, said Adam Helfgott. CEO at MadHive and project lead at the Mad Network. He said the company is in the process of raising $25 million in Bitcoin to fund the development of the Mad Network.
A blockchain, which acts as a peer-to-peer network, facilitates the exchange of data without the need for third-party verification. The move will give advertisers more opportunities to establish new connections with consumers, and publishers will gain insight to better understand their audiences.
Helfgott believes this technology will change the media industry. "For every dollar spent on linear television that doesn't go through digital, about 80 cents goes to the publisher," he said. "As soon as I put that show on Hulu or anywhere online, I get 20 cents."
The Mad Network consists of three businesses: Books, Core, and Data. Books, an automated bookkeeping network, runs on top of Ethereum to house insertion orders. Core is an ad server, and Data supports a data management platform (DMP).
Government regulations could introduce challenges. The United States does not yet have many regulations, but South Korea is implementing new bitcoin guidelines that would prohibit minors from tom investing in cryptocurrencies and possibly taxing capital gains made from bitcoin trades.
South Korea, which banned initial coin offerings in September, is the third-largest market for bitcoin, and the biggest for bitcoin rivals Ethereum and Litecoin. The move follows bitcoin’s debut on a U.S. exchange, according to one report ( ).----




http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/07/16/envisionx-bring-blockchain-programmatic-advertising/

EnvisionX ( ) , an independent advertising technology company and provider of programmatic advertising solutions, has today announced the launch of BitCasts,  a programmatic platform solution, integrated with Blockchain technology.
By introducing a Blockchain element into its existing advertising technology, EnvisionX will advance global programmatic advertising to the next level and also add an extra layer of security to the platforms to help combat issues facing the industry.
BitCasts will address major worldwide buyer problems, such as currency, which is usually in US dollars. By adding cryptocurrency capabilities with Blockchain, buyers can purchase media in local currency without exchange rate complications. In addition BitCasts will also tackle the issue of long payment turnaround to publishers, and transparency issues will also be addressed, by allowing users to see exactly how much money is spent when a campaign is delivered and on which publisher. In turn the publisher will be able see precisely how much the buyer has paid, enabling real transparency along the chain whilst also combating fraudulent activity.
EnvisionX currently offers two products which will be further enhanced with the new technology. AdTrades is a versatile and dynamic advertising marketplace that is available for immediate trade between any programmatically enabled buyer or seller, giving buyers access to multiple supply-side platforms (SSPs) and their verified advertising inventory or media. AdCasts is a “ready-to-go” robust SaaS platform which makes it easy for advertisers to get programmatically set-up without having to build a demand-side platform (DSP)  themselves.
BitCasts will beta launch in 2017, with the full version being available to customers by 2018. If you would like more information on EnvisionX and its programmatic solutions, please visit – To sign up to the newsletter about BitCasts, please visit ( ).

Blockchain ( ) — which originated in financial services and is essentially an open ledger (a massive spreadsheet) of transaction data — is a new ad tech solution in town. Its promise is to provide advertisers more transparency and solve problems related to ad fraud ( ) and brand safety ( ).
The underlying technology of blockchain is sophisticated, but how it works is straightforward. In its simplest form, blockchain works as a community. For instance, if a brand buys inventory from 10 publishers programmatically, the 10 publishers, the supply-side platforms that those publishers work with, the advertiser’s media agencies, demand-side platforms and the brand itself could form a group where members have different levels of access to a ledger. Pavel Cherkashin, co-founder and CEO for Blockchain Programmatic Corporation, explained that the multiple access levels allow only authorized parties in the transaction to access the data for audit purposes, while the remaining members have access to aggregate data for analysis and modeling purposes, etc. Transactional data is encrypted to ensure its protection.
“Each member of the network is a ‘node’ storing a certain amount of data on their servers and earning rewards, or tokens, for processing this data,” said Cherkashin. “They also conduct the audit and crowdsourcing of the data to ensure its accuracy and compliance.”
Blockchain is still in its early days, but some industry initiatives use it ( ). For instance, Nasdaq said in March that it is providing blockchain technology to power a startup called the New York Interactive Advertising Exchange that trades guaranteed advertising contracts, while the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Tech Lab formed a blockchain working group in September led by GroupM’s mPlatform and NYIAX. (It is hosting its first full working group meeting on Nov. 1.)
Ken Brook, CEO for blockchain ad platform MetaX, said that in an unreleased beta test of blockchain with an undisclosed advertiser, his team discovered that between bot traffic, invalid banner video and unauthorized inventory sellers, more than 30 percent of the advertiser’s online ad spend wasn’t what it paid for.
“There is an immense problem around disparate data sets, especially when these numbers are used to justify ad spend and return,” said Brook. “There is also a lot of obscurity on how inventory is sold and resold.”
Cherkashin added that neither SSPs nor DSPs can provide the required level of trust and ability to process data as crowdsourcing in blockchain does. After all, with blockchain, the intermediary is a robot, not a human, so people can trust it with their data.
Cherkashin’s team patented the concept of multilayer blockchain, where 100,000 independent blockchains can work concurrently, which allows the system to process more than 1 million transactions per second, according to Cherkashin. “The compromise we need to accept is that there is no real-time consensus between all of the blockchains, but for advertising audit and data analysis, this is not required,” he added.
It is widely reported ( ) that one big problem with blockchain’s application in programmatic buying is the technology is not capable of handling millions of bid requests per second. “I don’t think blockchain is the solution. From what I’ve read, blockchain can only handle around 2,000 transactions per second, while in programmatic, we are doing millions of transactions per second,” said Nick Jordan, founder of data trading company Narrative “Ad tech likes to add layers of solutions on top of other solutions.”
Jordan said that even if blockchain can process 100 billion ad impressions per day, only three or four organizations like Google and Amazon have the computing power to manage the large databases required by that volume, which goes against the promise of blockchain: a distributed ledger. “Basically, the industry goes back to the hands of walled gardens,” he said.
Drew Bradstock, svp of product for Index Exchange, echoed Jordan’s sentiment. Bradstock said SSPs, DSPs and publishers can work together to provide advertisers more transparency. If advertisers and publishers rely on blockchain, there will probably be an ad tax on using the solution.

http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/03/02/blockchain-the-answer-programmatic-advertising-s-woes

Following on from our article on media’s perfect storm ( ) , we’ve been asked by a couple of clients what we think about blockchain. Is it the answer to the problems posed by programmatic advertising and the perils of automatic ad placements?
The advantage a blockchain has is that it’s very secure, and that records cannot be altered retrospectively without all the other records being similarly altered. And the longer the chain runs, the more secure it becomes. The blockchain organisation Ethereum ( ) allows almost anyone to contribute their computer to the network, simply by installing some software. Distribution helps to reduce tampering, fraud and cyber crime. With so many computers taking part, systems are also very hard to “take down” via traditional brute force network attacks (eg DDS – Distributed Denial of Service – attacks).
So, blockchain seems to be one of the wonders of the cyber-age, and has almost limitless practical and useful applications. Some advocates have predicted that it will transform the way we all do business – and it might well.
Certainly it’s got plenty of people in the marcomms industry very excited. Last week one of the world’s most powerful marketers, Unilever's Keith Weed, announced that he’d enlisted IBM iX, (IBM’s business strategy arm) to create a blockchain solution to simplify the Unilver digital ad supply chain and provide more transparency and, consequently, build more trust – and Weed sees trust as a key issue not just for the industry, but for consumers too.
As many observers have pointed out, the problem with digital advertising is that it’s become less transparent – and in the eyes of many clients – increasingly untrustworthy; the very opposite of what was supposed to happen. As fraud (I don’t think that’s too strong a word) and automation increased, more and more middlemen were introduced into the advertising supply chain in order to fix the problems.
A related issue is one of sustainability. Blockchains use tremendous amounts of energy. According to Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ( ) , cryptocurrency Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05TWh, which represents 0.13% of total global electricity consumption. That means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries! This consumption isn’t just bad for the environment, it costs a lot of money. Microsoft has been exploring the possibility of underwater data centers ( ) to deal with the heat generated – watch out Mr Polar Bear.
And what of security? Enthusiasts for blockchain often say it’s 100% safe, but that’s not entirely true. Blockchain is currently mostly used for cryptocurrencies, and in the past decade or so, a fifth of all Bitcoins have been stolen, hacked or scammed – more than $2bn worth. Although the tech has thus far proven robust, that doesn’t mean that this will always be the case.
Salon Media Group, an online publisher, is offering its readers a choice ( ) – allow it to display ads, or instead lend it your computer’s processing power so it can mine cryptocurrencies. Make of that what you will.
Ultimately, nobody knows what’s possible. We’re in the wild west again, just as we were 25 years ago. Babs Rangaiah, another senior Unilever marketer (and a big advocate of the use of blockchain in advertising) says: “It’s like 1992 for the internet when we had no idea what was possible and when. We had an idea of what it could do, but not how soon we’d get there. That’s where we’re at with blockchain.”
Moving into uncharted territory is always exhilarating, but presents challenges. There will be outlaws and con-men, as well as prospectors and fearless pioneers. Blockchain might be a (or even the) solution but we need to keep our eyes and ears wide open.----

New technologies are always around the corner, and it is a matter of time until we all become old people who can’t understand and keep up with even the most basic of tech. The latest addition to the list of technologies that make us question our savviness is blockchain ( ).
According to blockchain industry statistics, it is being integrated into the global financial sector at a rapid pace, especially in banking. Banks in countries like Japan, the US, Belarus, Switzerland, and a few others are already accepting cryptocurrency transactions as a part of their system, and more will follow suit shortly.
The IoT industry is already a billion-dollar industry ( ) , and there are also billions of IoT devices ( ) scattered all over the world. These IoT ( ) devices were built to enhance the human experience, improve the efficiency of specific tools and the automation processes.
Statistics for blockchain show that bringing blockchain into the fold will significantly enhance the security of data exchange between connected devices and the IoT platforms. Plus, there is the added advantage of automated backup files in case of a successful breach. This is ensured by the millions of individual nodes in the blockchain that help to store system data.
Each year, there is a significant increase in the growth rate of blockchain technology. Blockchain stats for 2021 show that blockchain will become a mainstay across major industries. As of 2017, blockchain was growing at a CAGR rate of 35.2%. In 2018, this figure increased to 41.8%.
Others like manufacturing and energy utilities have 12% each, healthcare (11%), government (8%), retail (4%), and media and entertainment (1%). Globally, about 77% of the financial sector could have blockchain-enabled services as a part of their system and processes.
Blockchain wallets are digital wallets that enable you to store and manage your cryptocurrency transactions ( ). According to blockchain wallet statistics, in *Q4 2016* , there were just *10.98 million blockchain wallets* in existence. Fast forward to halfway through *2021* , and over *70 million wallets* had already been created. Again, this goes to show how valuable blockchain has become in the past few years.
According to statistics on the blockchain, the lowest number of mempool additions ever recorded was 1.133 transactions per second on January 27th, 2018. The *highest value ever recorded was 7.56 transactions per second* recorded on May 2nd, 2019. As of June 22nd, 2021, the rate stands at 2.58 
Blockchain only comes second to artificial intelligence and machine learning ( ) as the most disruptive technologies in recent times. Blockchain has found usefulness in almost every sector where it has been applied. From manufacturing to agriculture, insurance, banking, and many more.
According to blockchain market statistics, the healthcare sector is one of the heaviest spenders on blockchain technology. Blockchain statistics in the US show that the US alone spends 20% of its GDP on the health sector.
This is a stark difference when compared to the stats recorded in 2016, 2017, and 2018. According to blockchain usage statistics, back then, more than half of all chief information officers (CIO) surveyed had no plans to incorporate blockchain technology into their business. This goes to show how blockchain is fast becoming a mainstay alongside AI in a data-driven economy like ours.
As the demand for blockchain technology increases, so is the creation of newer enterprise blockchain vendors that offer suitable services. However, Gartner predicts that most of these vendors will need replacement soon due to rapid evolution, shifting competitive landscape, and possible early-stage technology failures.
According to blockchain healthcare statistics, blockchain in healthcare can allow for interoperability and the transfer of patient information from one health center to another without complication or misinformation.
According to recent blockchain statistics for business, 23% of respondents cite value chain and new business models as the main reasons why they adopted blockchain. Another 23% claim that they would do so for a higher degree of security. Considering there are numerous cybercrime statistics ( ) that prove how serious this problem is, the stat above isn't surprising at all.
It started back in 2008 and moved on to become a global phenomenon. There are now over 70 million bitcoin wallets around the world. New cryptocurrencies are coming up every month. The age of cryptofinance has begun.
There is no certainty who this person is exactly, but the *long suspicion is that he's a Japanese-American* man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, *from Temple City, LA.* Even though he keeps denying any involvement with the blockchain and Bitcoin creation, there are too many coincidences not to consider him as the most likely candidate for the role of the creator of Bitcoin. For example, one of his neighbors, a computer scientist by the name of Hal Finney, was the first person ever to receive a Bitcoin transaction.
Numerous people also suspect that Finney himself is behind blockchain and that he just used his neighbor’s name as a pseudonym. Others believe that Satoshi Nakamoto is actually a global group of people, who want to implement a new banking and transaction system.
* *Gibraltar* is the first country to regulate cryptocurrency trading by forming a Financial Services Commission that deals with issuing licenses for operation, ICOs, as well as controls the organizations that work with cryptocurrencies.
* *Malta* is also known as a blockchain hub, as there are numerous crypto and blockchain companies established there. The country regulates the industry very well, and this is why Malta is one of the top picks for those who want to start a business in this industry.
* *Bermuda* is the choice for companies that wish to save on taxes, as there are no additional taxes apart from the minimum payroll tax of 10%. Companies such as Google save billions of dollars by forming subsidiaries in this tropical paradise.
* *Slovenia* is ranked 14th on the list of population life satisfaction. Apart from happy citizens, Slovenia offers cheap hydropower and cloud mining services that are both compelling arguments for any startup that wants to work with cryptocurrencies or blockchain.
Blockchain stats show that in January of 2015 the number of people around the globe, who had a blockchain wallet, was just over 3 million. In 2017, the number had increased to nearly 13 million, while in June 2018 that number was above 28.8 million. Constantly increasing, the *number of blockchain wallet users reached 42 million in September 2019*.
According to blockchain security statistics, one of the *largest breaches in cryptocurrency* happened this year on *Coincheck*. More than *58 billion yen, or 500 million dollars* , was transferred from Coincheck’s wallet to another account. The coin in question was not a well-known one, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but a rather new one named NEM coin. The average value of a single coin was just under a dollar, with more than 534 million NEM coins being taken by the hackers ( ).
(Source: Globe News Wire) *Blockchain and IoT are an* *excellent pair* ( ). Both have been growing rapidly over the last few years and will continue to rely on each other. Blockchain can offer the security lacking with intelligent devices. On the other hand, blockchain growth will be possible via IoT.
An initiative was started by Microsoft and Accenture to *build a blockchain-based ID network for refugee* s, *illegal aliens* , and *people who don’t have government-issued documents*. This group is rather large, and more than 1 billion people across the globe are currently not able to prove their identity, so the significance of this action is immeasurable for those unable to gain access to healthcare, education, and other basic services.
One of the blockchain statistics shows that over 270 billion dollars worth of cryptocurrencies has been managed and distributed using this method. Since 2010, blockchain has been ahead of Western Union when it comes to the amount of money transferred each year. *Western Union handles around 5.5 billion dollars in money transfers*.
The FBI has been involved in the cryptocurrency market ever since fraud cases started spiking. The agency received over 20 million dollars in funding, dedicated to preventing and fighting cybercrimes ( ) , and it has also seized roughly the same amount of money in Bitcoin. Both of these sources combine to make the FBI one of the *largest holders of Bitcoin in the world* , with more than *1.5%* of all Bitcoin in their possession.
Blockchain adoption statistics show that half a percent of the human population is currently using blockchain technology, or somewhere around *40 million people*. According to even the most conservative estimates, this number is expected to *quadruple in 5 years* , and in 10 years, *80%* of the population *will be involved with the blockchain technology* in some form.
Ripple is a company based in San Francisco and it is one of the biggest winners in the game that is cryptocurrency investing. The founders of Ripple created a coin named XRP which quickly gained traction and earned this company more than *30 billion dollars in a matter of months*.
Some industries *need population data in order to improve their production* , and the pharmaceutical industry is one of them. The more available data there is, the more efficient the drug development process can become. The same goes for testing and even customer satisfaction.
Blockchain will probably disrupt many industries. Financial companies alone can save up to $12 billion a year from using the technology. The global blockchain technology market is estimated to accumulate 20 billion dollars in revenue by 2024.
The global blockchain technology market is estimated to accumulate 20 billion dollars in revenue by the year 2024, as evident by blockchain growth statistics. The revenue blockchain achieved in 2015 was just over 315 million dollars; therefore, a *significant increase in the use and revenue of blockchain is expected in the years ahead*.
The *United States* is the *biggest regional spender when it comes to blockchain*. Western Europe will be the second-biggest client for the technology ($1.6 billion), and China will take third place ($777 million). Central and Eastern Europe will show a *CAGR of 50%* , while China’s will be *54.6% within five years*.
With every major industry investing in blockchain technologies, current estimates show that the business value of blockchain will be worth more than 360 billion dollars, in just *6 years from now*. By the year *2030* , the business value is projected to go over the *3 trillion dollar mark* , setting blockchain to be one of the most lucrative industries.
In addition to bringing an immense increase in the security of transactions, blockchain technology can also *save billions of dollars* to industries by *cutting the costs of data transfer and storage*.
Banks around the world *spend more than two-thirds of their IT budgets* in order to *support outdated methods of data storage*. What is concerning is that those outdated methods of storage hold personal information about the clients, as well as numerous other pieces of sensitive data, and they are not even close to being secure.
Blockchain offers a way to store sensitive data safely, with encryption ( ) and millions of storage points, none of which contain one full name or an account number. In addition to providing security, blockchain can offer a *reduction in upkeep* costs by up to 30%, *or 12 billion dollars* , as mentioned previously.
Most of the business leaders, or 71% of them to be exact, who are already using blockchain technology think it plays a key role in driving their progress. *Technological advances in the logistics* and *shipping* industry would be *significantly slower without blockchain* , and this especially applies to ocean shipping.
Blockchain stats show us that the private sector isn’t the only one that sees the potential in the blockchain. 90% of government agencies and organizations also plan on investing in blockchain, and they plan to do so this year.
Apart from *reducing the time and risk of enforcing regulatory compliance* , blockchain-based technologies can *help government organizations increase their transparency and establish clear audit trails*.
When questioned about what blockchain models they’re focusing on, *52%* of organizations answered they’re focusing on a permissioned blockchain model. Sometimes those blockchain technology statistics can just blow your mind, can’t they?
(Source: Statista) *Consumer products* and the *manufacturing industry* are among the *first ones to incorporate blockchain technology* into their daily dealings. 74% of those involved in the survey stated their company is well on the way to use blockchain for most of their business and that their company is either currently experimenting with blockchain, or has already moved to the production phase.
Once again, blockchain usage statistics show that what companies are most interested in is employing blockchain technology in order to improve their logistics and supply chains. *More than half of executives state* that this is what *they intend to use the technology for*.
36% of Europeans working in the payments industry predict that blockchain will have an impact in this sector, and change some aspects of the industry by 2025. Professionals from the payments industry mostly *believe that the changes will impact their work positively*.
Coinbase ( ) , one of the major digital currency exchanges ( ) , *received venture capital funding of more than 250 million dollars* between *2014 and 2017*. During this three-year period, Coinbase managed to turn the massive amount of investments into an exchange market that is used by millions of people around the world.
Its growth was always projected as colossal, but no one could have foreseen that the market would *grow by over 150 billion dollars in just two years* , in South Korea alone. Even more surprisingly, this market is *predicted to more than double its current value* in just four years, reaching 356.2 billion dollars.
Gamers are known as a group that is most willing to accept new internet trends. It should come as no surprise that 44% of them *purchased or traded game-related items on the blockchain*. The most commonly used method of purchase is Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum and XRP.
According to data and blockchain adoption statistics from the end of March of this year, there are 109 Chinese companies providing blockchain applications in the real economy. The *companies sell blockchain-based innovations that help banks* and similar institutions *function more efficiently while lowering costs*.
However, as the stories of the blockchain’s efficiency and security started spreading, more and more users from the healthcare branch started experimenting. Considering the numerous data breaches in healthcare ( ) , it’s no surprise that *55%* of the industry’s administrative needs *will be conducted using blockchain tech by 2025*.
Regulatory issues got in the way of 39% of companies, who wanted to invest larger amounts of money in blockchain technologies. This is the main *reason why blockchain startups are more common in countries that have optimized their regulations for this technology*.
KuCoin is a company *from Singapore* that *specializes in cryptocurrency trading*. This year, they have decided to invest *3 million dollars in Bitcoin Australia* , which is the company in charge of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in this part of the world.
Bittrex is another blockchain *trading platform that operates from Seattle*. It supports the trade of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and nearly 200 other cryptocurrencies. People from around the world can trade on Bittrex, including those from Latin America and the Caribbean. They are tracking Bitcoin stats live, so they should know.
Floyd Mayweather was *one of the first public personas to endorse a cryptocurrency*. He backed the infamous Centra coin, which had a great start and showed a lot of promise. After raising more than 32 million dollars in their Initial Coin Offering (ICO), *Centra* was quickly *shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission* (SEC) due to *fraudulent activities*. The founders of Centra were quickly arrested, and those who invested in this new coin had, sadly, lost on their investment.
The banking industry and the financial sector, in general, have spent more than 550 million dollars on blockchain in 2018. It is projected that the spending *will keep increasing by 75% every year* for the foreseeable future, with the potential of jumping even more in 2022.
The *second-largest spende* r when it comes to the blockchain is the *distribution and services sector* , with almost 380 million dollars spent on it this year. The benefits that blockchain technology brings to this sector are numerous, and there are more and more applications of this technology being discovered every day.
Another sector that is *spending hundreds of millions* on the blockchain is the *manufacturing and resources sector*. With more than 330 million dollars spent on blockchain-based technologies in 2018, the sector is looking to improve its business and revenue by employing the new trends in blockchain technology in various ways; from manufacturing automation to data storage.
Companies that provide *financial services* , *media* , *transportation* , and *consumer products* , as well as those *providing basic needs such as health care* , are all expected to start incorporating blockchain technology into their daily business.
With all of them ditching the old ways and moving their transaction and record storage keeping needs to the new technology, experts reckon that this tech’s global market size is definitely going to increase in value.
Blockchain is a technology that is still considered to be in its infant stage. Numerous companies shifting their payment needs from standard cash options to cryptocurrencies, accompanied by multiple industries moving their transaction needs to the blockchain, are both factors in the estimation that its *global market is going to skyrocket in 2024*. The blockchain market size will be impressive, to say the least.
Spending on the blockchain is at an all-time high. Going by the trends, it will continue growing in years to come. Forecasts show that it will be at *$6.6 billion worldwide by the last quarter of 2021*.
According to blockchain stats, 13% of people in charge of *IT at large companies have made firm plans to implement blockchain* into their companies’ daily dealings. Decreased costs of data transfer are what interests their bosses, but IT executives are more interested in the aspect of security that blockchain offers.
Blockchain is currently most used for personal cryptocurrency transfers. People use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies to purchase various goods and services online ( ) ; same as they do with cash. If you’re interested in Blockchain predictions, we’ve got an interesting one for you.
However, over the next five years, it is expected that around *70%* of spending that involves blockchain as a medium will come from IT companies and other businesses. This data *matches all the other predictions about blockchain growth and incorporation into daily business transactions*.
IBM’s internet of things , or IoT, was the reason this company decided to invest 200 million dollars into blockchain. Anticipating a huge blockchain ROI, this company was *one of the first major supporters of the technology* and has so far *implemented multiple blockchain-based practices into its own business*. Starting with the dispute resolution system, then moving to security frameworks, and finally investing this insane amount of money into IoT and blockchain-based artificial intelligence.
Proving just how serious IBM is about blockchain, apart from the 200 million dollars they invested, is the fact that this company opened a new office in Germany that employs over 1,000 people. The Munich office has one goal in mind, and that is to *utilize the blockchain* to *develop and perfect its IoT project that aims to connect all devices with each other*.
Connecting vehicles, home appliances, computers, smartphones, and every other device imaginable through blockchain is a massive task. The first use of all these devices exchanging data would be to improve the efficiency of the global shipping industry. Further uses are basically numerous, ranging from exchanging data between self-driving cars to helping the elderly by autonomizing devices such as heaters, air conditioners, stoves, etc.
Blockchain is the technology of the future that everyone wants to, and should, get into. Supported by the fact that 90% of European and North American banks are c *urrently exploring how blockchain affects their business* , this argument becomes stronger every day.
The average amount of money companies have invested in blockchain projects this year is 1 million dollars, as per available blockchain stats. This stands to show that blockchain is *no longer regarded as an enigma* by businesses and that they are definitely investing enough to reach those expectations set for 2024.
Cryptocurrencies have become a valid payment method in multiple areas we used to use cash. Buying consumer products online, paying for dinner, and even donating to charity can now all be done using crypto. According to data, more than *$69 million were donated last year in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency forms*.
Global spending on blockchain is projected to reach 11.7 billion dollars by the year 2022, more than five times we spent this year. IDC expects this growth to continue after 2022, at nearly the same rate of *73.2% per year*. This year has already beaten all expectations, with blockchain spending more than doubling from the year before, showing that this projection might even be conservative.
One of the biggest reasons behind the massive numbers included in the predictions about blockchain’s future is the fact that the *vast majority of firms in the financial sector are planning on incorporating it into their business in the next two years.*
Russian companies that work in the financial sector seem to be *more fond of blockchain than their global competitors*. 99% of Russian financial service companies plan to incorporate blockchain into their systems.
The security that comes with the use of blockchain is one of the *major factors that influence their decision to start moving transaction networks to the new age.* Safe to say, even the best antivirus solutions ( ) aren't as capable as the blockchain in terms of security.
Bitcoin's price is fluctuating. It is very difficult to forecast what it will be tomorrow. On the other hand, trading volumes keep getting bigger. There were transactions worth $300 million in September 2018 alone.
With nearly 18 million units in circulation, the *total value of the Bitcoin* market has exceeded *100 billion dollars*. Despite all the fluctuations and the value drop of over 10,000 dollars per unit in less than a year, Bitcoin manages to keep the leading position among cryptocurrencies, both in value and the number of coins in circulation.
The volume of Bitcoin exchange is staggering, with blockchain statistics showing nearly 300 million dollars worth of Bitcoin being traded in September 2018 alone. Bitcoin accounts for *15%* of *all cryptocurrency exchange trade volume*.
Blockchain size is going to keep increasing, with *one block being added to the end of the chain every 10 minutes* , on average. Even when all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined the transactions will still need to be processed, keeping the number of blocks increase at roughly the same rate.
One of the main appeals of using blockchain and cryptocurrencies instead of banks or PayPal is the fact that there is no central authority behind them. There is *no one controlling who is sending and receiving data through blockchain* , or for what purpose they are using the service.
Ethereum, currently the most dominant cryptocurrency, *grew more than 1500% during 2017*. With more than 1.2 million transactions, *Ethereum* was *four times more popular than Bitcoin* , and it reached the peak *value of 1,200 dollars per unit*. That’s some Ethereum statistics for you.
There are 96 countries in the world that don’t restrict Bitcoin usage, and they see more than 12,000 transactions every hour. There are over *99,000 BTC sent every hour* , with an average *value of 0.103 BTC* , or roughly *600 dollars per transaction*.
As of September of this year, there are 188, 912 Bitcoin transactions conducted every day. The chart of *Bitcoin transactions is constantly fluctuating* , reaching its peak during *December 2017* with more than *400,000 transactions*. The first-ever transaction and the day Bitcoin transactions were the slowest, was in January 2009.
In order for Bitcoin transactions to be completed, more than just Bitcoin miners need to be involved in the process. The messages that Bitcoin relays through the network are called nodes, and they are sent out in order to ensure the speed and security of transfers. The more nodes there are, the safer the network.
The majority of bitnodes are based within just 3 countries. The *US* is the *largest percentage area* of bitnode concentration, and *23.6%* of them come from here. *Germany* is second, with *18.95%* , while *6.82%* of all bitnodes come from *France*.
Bitcoin has always been a highly valued cryptocurrency, starting its journey back in 2013 with a market value of 135 dollars. It reached its highest value point in 2017, peaking at 16,350 dollars, and suddenly starting to plummet down to less than *6,500 dollars* where it used to be in *October of 2018*.
Bitcoin has failed every expectation for this last year, as there were some experts predicting this cryptocurrency to reach over 50,000 dollars per unit during 2018. Due to the rise of other currencies and the hustle, it takes to mine, *Bitcoin is looking to stay on the downward spiral for the foreseeable future*.
Ethereum started its journey to the cryptocurrency market significantly lower in value compared to Bitcoin. In 2015, the price of Ethereum was just 1.46 dollars per unit. This cryptocurrency reached its peak value in *January of 2018, at 1135 dollars*. Following the trends of the crypto market, Ethereum started losing in value, and in *October of 2018* , it is sitting at just under *200 dollars per unit*. Some interesting Ether stats, don’t you think?
Those who invested in either of these currencies and decided to sell near the end of 2017 have definitely made the right call, while those deciding to wait a bit more will need to sit tight for a while until the prices rise again, or take a massive loss.
Blockchain stats show that the time it takes to confirm a *Bitcoin transaction is 10 minutes, on average*. This time can be variable though, as the transaction time depends on the number of blocks currently available and created by miners. In some instances, such as during January of 2018, it can take a lot longer to process a transaction, and during this period it took nearly 3,000 minutes, or more than 2 days for a single transaction to complete.
During a conference earlier this year, the information that *4 million Bitcoins are lost* , and another *2 million stolen* was revealed by a former executive at one of the major trading platforms. Due to loss and theft, 6 million Bitcoins are not accessible or permanently lost, lowering the total amount of Bitcoins available to under 15 million. The loss of those coins is estimated to increase the value of Bitcoin in the near future.
As the value of Bitcoin started rapidly increasing a few years ago, the mining became more prominent. In fact, it became such a prominent source of additional income that Bitcoin miners across the globe were using more electricity than 159 countries use. *Ireland* , the *Balkans* , and most of *Africa use less electricity than mining does*. *Bitcoin mining is estimated to use around 29 TWh per year*.
There are over *100 million Ether in circulation* , and there are new ones being created every second. A single block of this cryptocurrency is created together with 5 new Ether and the process takes between 14 and 15 seconds. That’s Ethereum mining stats for you.
The first one proved to be a failure. Not many people were interested in it, and it has so far seen *just over 2 million coins moved*. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, has been more successful, with over *6.5 million coins moved on the network in a year*.
As of the second month of *2021* , there were *82 crypto wallets for both Bitcoin and altcoins ( )*. The most popular one was *Ledger Nano S* , supporting *472 digital currencies*. Following was *Trezor Wallet* that operates *190 coin* types, then *Unstoppable Wallet with 123*.
According to blockchain statistics, there were *2.2 million downloads for different crypto apps in December 2020*. A *month later* , that amount shot to *5.6 million* , which led to an increase in Bitcoin prices.
The largest known *deep web market for (mostly) illegal trade was created in 2011* , and by the time it was *shut down in 2015* over *1 billion dollars worth of illegal drugs and items was sold on it*. Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison as the main person behind Silk Road, following the testimonies of the parents of those who overdosed after purchasing drugs on his market.
Similar to Silk Road, a dark web market known as *Sheep Marketplace* was involved in shady dealings. The difference between the two is that Sheep Marketplace shut down unexpectedly in 2013, *claiming to be the victim of hacking*. The amount of Bitcoin on the marketplace at the time was estimated to be worth around 40 million dollars, and it was nowhere to be seen.
Tomáš Jiříkovský, the main person behind Sheep Marketplace, was caught trying to launder some of the stolen Bitcoins two years after the marketplace shut down, earning himself 10 to 18 years in prison.
Ethereum has also been targeted by hackers multiple times, with the *most successful one stealing 50 million dollars worth of Ether in 2016*. The hacker *targeted a blockchain* that contained more than *150 million dollars worth of the cryptocurrency* , but the action was taken in order to try and regain the Ether stolen. Unfortunately for some of those storing their coins in this block, the hacker knew the weaknesses of the system and managed to keep a third for himself.
The *first-ever purchase conducted using Bitcoin* occurred on *22 May 2010* , when *Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two Papa John’s pizzas*. In order to understand how much of a better choice it would have been to save those coins for later, we can compare Laszlo with Peter Saddington who purchased a Lamborghini Huracan just five years later for 45 Bitcoins. The Bitcoins spent on two pizzas would be worth around 280 million dollars today.
James Howells *used his personal laptop to mine Bitcoin since 2009*. The laptop was sold, but Howells kept the hard drive that the coins were stored on, just in case all those mined Bitcoins are worth something someday. His *fatal error* occurred in 2013 when he was cleaning his home and *mistakenly placed the drive into the bag that was meant for the garbage*. The bag traveled to the landfill in Newport, where it remains buried to this day.
The Bitcoin network has *100,000 times more power than the top 500 computers on the planet combined*. The amount of data being processed every second using Bitcoin blockchain is so immense that it would take a supercomputer decades to go through. This is exactly where the strength of blockchain lays.
Wikileaks, the famous whistleblower website, relied for most of its existence on users’ donations. After all donation methods such as VISA, MasterCard, and PayPal stopped supporting donations to Wikileaks, the site decided to start accepting crypto donations.
According to blockchain facts , *the average amount of Bitcoin mined daily is 900.* Since *the last Bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020* , the *reward of each confirmed block* has reduced to *6.25 Bitcoins.* Now, if *144 blocks are mined daily* on an average, and the prize is 6.25 Bitcoin for each block, we have that *144 X 6.25 Bitcoins per block = 900

The map above shows which countries consume less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining. You can see an update for late 2018 here ( ) Bitcoin’s ongoing meteoric price rise has received the bulk of recent press attention with a lot of discussion around whether or not it’s a bubble waiting to burst.
However, most the coverage has missed out one of the more interesting and unintended consequences of this price increase. That is the surge in global electricity consumption used to “mine” more Bitcoins.
That’s the equivalent of *0.13%* of total global electricity consumption. While that may not sound like a lot, it means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries (as you can see from the map above). More than Ireland or Nigeria.
* Number of Britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: *6.1 million* (more than the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Bradford, Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon, Coventry, Leicester & Nottingham combined) Or Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
E.g. Ireland currently consumes an estimated 25 TWh of electricity per year, so global Bitcoin mining consumption is 116%, or 16% more than they consume. The UK consumes an estimated 309 TWh of electricity per year so global Bitcoin mining consumption is only equivalent to 9.4% of the UK total.
Which European countries consume more or less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining As mentioned, above the data for Bitcoin mining energy consumption comes from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ( ). You can read about their assumptions here ( ).
Electricity consumption data mostly comes from the CIA via Wikipedia ( ) and is mostly for 2014, since that’s the most recent year available. Unlike some other sources it includes, residential, commercial and industrial use, so may be higher than other figures quoted elsewhere.
The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates consumption has increased by *29.98%* over the past month. If that growth rate were to continue, and countries did not add any new power generating capacity, Bitcoin mining would:
In the UK it would even more expensive, assuming you paid the rock bottom price of 10.10 pence per kilowatthour ( Bulb’s prices ( ) for London homes) it would still cost *£2.93 billion ($3.89 billion)*.
This means the estimated annualised global mining revenues now stand at *$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)* , which even at the more expensive estimates listed above, means it’s still very profitable.
Can anyone estimate how much carbon is being released into the atmosphere as a result of this electricity usage? I wonder how this would compare to the emissions required to mine an equally valuable amount of a precious metal like gold.
Yes I have stopped producing it properly as it’s not longer safe and is being farmed for other worlds to allow input era to wipe out most of mankind am the original fist blood provided of self provided nd unlimited sustabeavle energy provider also the directors of the worlds network 02 and EE signed in blood
To construct a good argument you need to present both sides of it and then counter the opposing side. A one sided argument is never an efficient argument, it’s just an opinion piece which we really don’t need more of.
But we can do that comparison right off the top of our heads. The Bitcoin blockchain does one block about every 10 minutes, or about 6 blocks per hour. Each block contains about 1,500 transactions, or about 7,500 transactions per hour. For simplicity, let’s call it 10,000 transactions per hour. That’s 240,000 transactions per day. Let’s be generous (again) and round up to 300,000 transactions day, which is a number commonly seen. Let’s also include the complaints in the comment above (e.g. and ) and grant that the real number might only be 20% of the numbers quoted in the original article. Now, how many financial transactions do you execute each day? Counting everything – buying lunch, buying gas, public transit tickets, parking, all your shopping, all your periodic bills, everything? For me it’s maybe 3 – 6 per day. So the entire worldwide Bitcoin system is only doing enough transactions to support a town of maybe 100,000 people. And do that it’s using more electricity than some of the world’s nations, even with the adjustments above. I know this is weird and hard to accept, but it seems to be true. Come on, the whole system can barely support the transaction rate one medium sized town! From this we can conclude that other transaction system must be at least millions of times more energy efficient, or there wouldn’t be enough electricity on Earth to support them.
So, basically you are saying that if the trend continues, banks and other institutions will also consume 100% of world energy production by 2020 or sooner. If that is true, we are doomed because we now have at least two financial branches which are going to suck all the energy by 2020 (actually much sooner if we add them both together). Hummmm…..
OK, that aside. Who said that this was a comparative analyses of Bitcoin and its competitors? You make too many assumtions, IMO. The writer simply added this analyses. To have a whole picture you need to start from the dots and lines. Maybe you could go on an do the next bit?
It’s uncanny how similar those two maps are. Could it be that the cost for maintaining that $135 billion in value costs more than the electricity used for the entire economy of a country that has nowhere near that kind of GDP?? Also the comparison here is comparing GLOBAL usage against individual countries…. gimme a break. This gives no indication as to the efficiency of the mining nor to the individual economies. It’s just incendiary emotional comparisons.
Given that to avoid the worst of climate change, we need to be halving emissions every decade, and doubling renewables every five years, having this Frankenstein technology stalking the planet is very bad news indeed.
Because of these high energy demands there are some alternatives in which the mining process relies on stored data (in your hard drive disk) instead of real-time computations. By doing this, the energy demand is minimal. The only coin already doing this is Burstcoin.
This is true for the time being perhaps. Bitcoin is a new technology that has some sustainability issues to contend with sure. But, if more people encouraged the solutions rather than only pointed out the problems, we would have quicker evolution to maturity. The solution is renewable energy sources! Very simple and yet profound! We need to be able to assist miners into shifting into this solution!! Please spread the word to any of your miner friends. I know a few who are solely running their mining operations on So perfect!!! More innovation please!!
I’m totally new to these concepts and find it all quite bizarre–like some kind of sci-fi tale. So the Bitcoin network consists of immense processor farms whose sole purpose is to generate new blocks of transaction data, for which they receive some number of bitcoins as payment. And some people *want* to spend the huge sums of money (with attendant energy usage) to set up mining operations to get those bitcoins because they are worth… intrinsically nothing.
Every article about Bitcoin equates their “value” to US dollars or some other traditional currency. If the ability to trade bitcoin for other money, or for products or services, collapses all those processor farms are performing worthless calculations. Is this really a self-sustaining economy?
Meanwhile, the fiendish design of the blockchain concept–requiring all this computational work to maintain the system–and the crazy amounts of energy needed to perform the calculations, makes it sound even more like some kind of creepy sci-fi story! Like an evil character tricks a whole population into ruining their own world by creating factories that do nothing but use energy and generate heat.
No gamer has a dozen machines all hammering away at 100% load while they do nothing with it. Bitcoin mining is essentially a exercise in waste creation. The allocation of some sort of fiscal ‘worth’ to the result only makes it even more grotesque in its greed. Using resources up to produce nothing of value is the exact opposite of progress.
Given that the first sentence above is a fact. However, the second sentence is not a fact as it is based on an assumption that is mathematically flawed. Even if bitcoin mining electricity consumption continues to grow exponentially, this does not necessarily translate into a constant 29.98% monthly increase.
This is due to the fact that as any number trending upwards continues to increase, it takes a much larger constant growth to continue to equal the percentage growth of the previous month. For example, assuming constant growth of 2 per month, if 10 grows to 12 in one month, that equals a 20% growth rate for that month – (2 10 = 20%). If 12 grows to 14 the next month, the growth rate declines from 20% to 16.7% – (2 12 = 16.7%). And if 14 grows to 16 the next month, the growth rate declines further from 16.7% to 14.3% – (2 14 = 14.3%). Furthermore, it 16 grows to 18 the next month, the growth rate declines to 12.5% – (2 16 = 12.5%). Finally, if 30 grows to 32 at the end of the 12th month, the growth rate declines to only 6.7% – (2 30 = 6.7%). Yet the growth is constant at 2 per month.
In conclusion, there is plenty of room for Bitcoin mining energy consumption to grow without it reaching a constant 29.98% growth rate per month – which is based on nothing but a hypothetical. The energy consumption could grow exponentially and incredibly over the next few years and still fall short of the 29.98% monthly increase solely due to the inherent mathematical decrease in percentage growth rates over a given period of time.
The ground rules for understanding the “Bitcoin” function need to be set, especially where confusion exists concerning the “Bitcoin mining” function that is described as if it is the same as actually digging a mineral out of the ground. It isn’t!
Money, in whatever way you seek to describe it, is an abstract notion. That abstract notion does not burn up energy, it is not a material thing and it is of no benefit in sustaining life, except as an exchange or transaction token for other things that are real and may sustain life—you can’t eat money but an apple may save you from hunger!
It’s all to do with how we use all sorts of ideas to “reify” material things. I find this subject difficult, but I remember when personal computers first arrived, they set out information storage in the analogy of a traditional hierarchic filing system—probably as the most efficient way of introducing computers in a way people could understand However those depictions of folders as icons are not really, ‘real’ folders (and data systems will continue to evolve in how we store and retrieve information, so that the old analogies will, no doubt, be replaced).
The Bitcoin certainly poses conceptual challenges but these things develop under the pressures social circumstances generate—and the phenomenon as an alternative to the current way we do business seems to have “anarchistic” redolences.
“Montesquieu describes commerce as an activity that cannot be confined or controlled by any individual government or monarch. This, in his view, has always been true: “Commerce is sometimes destroyed by conquerors, sometimes cramped by monarchs; it traverses the earth, flies from the places where it is oppressed, and stays where it has liberty to breathe” (SL 21.5). However, the independence of commerce was greatly enhanced when, during the medieval period, Jews responded to persecution and the seizure of their property by inventing letters of exchange. “Commerce, by this method, became capable of eluding violence, and of maintaining everywhere its ground; the richest merchant having none but invisible effects, which he could convey imperceptibly wherever he pleased” (SL 21.20).

Bitcoin mining will consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020. – I find this extremely hard to believe although I’ve enjoyed reading the article some of the facts may be slightly – just slightly 🙂 exaggerated.
Energy is a global problem it has been for years we have been constantly developing products to reduce or use of electricity but still enhance our lifestyle from tvs moved from crt to plasma to led and bit coin goes the opposite waste as much energy as possible to earn coins seems a backward thought and for what an alternative to what we have already .
Last week i earnt my wages in cash (£) i went away paid hotel ,meals out ,cinema , shopping , a taxi ,drinks at a bar and car parking all with cash card yes these were all relatively small amounts but i can easily transfer larger amounts . all im trying to say is i cope relitively well without bitcoin and apart from a those who have a invested in it and need it desperately to climb surely most of us can see its not needed …----

Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, influencer and thought leader in the fields of business and technology, with a passion for using technology for the good of humanity. He is a best-selling author of 20 books, writes a regular column for Forbes and advises and coaches many of the world’s best-known organisations. He has over 2 million social media followers, 1 million newsletter subscribers and was ranked by LinkedIn as one of the top 5 business influencers in the world and the No 1 influencer in the UK.
At its most basic, a blockchain is a *computer file used for storing data* – information. Like any computer file (including the document you are reading now) it exists on a digital storage medium, such as a computer hard drive. And it takes the form of a string of binary “bits”, ones and zeros, which can be processed by computers to be made readable by humans.
This means that no one person, or entity (such as a corporation, or government) has control over the content of the file. While whoever is in control of the computer storing the file which you are reading now can edit it, to make whatever changes they like, that isn’t the case with a blockchain. Editing the blockchain is only possible if there is a consensus between the network of computers storing separate, but identical, versions of the blockchain. And this is made possible thanks to the second fundamental innovation of blockchain – cryptography.
*Cryptography* – from the ancient Greek words for “secret writing” – fundamentally means that the data which makes up a blockchain is encoded. In order to change the data, or in some cases (depending on the type of blockchain) even to read it, you need to be in possession of the private keys corresponding to the correct ‘block’ in the chain (see the next section on structure of a blockchain). If you had access to the computer storing the document you are reading now, it would be simple to edit this document. If this document was stored in a blockchain, however, you would need to input the codes to prove you had the right to make changes. If the codes do not match, then changes would not be accepted onto the other copies of the document, which, as explained above, are distributed across many (potentially an unlimited number) of other computers.
Putting all of these elements together meant the ‘double spend’ problem formerly inherent to digital data was solved for the first time. Because a computer file (data) can be copied and shared an endless number of times, it was generally impossible to use it as a store of value (like gold, or cash, or a valuable work of art, for example). With blockchain technology this is different, which has led to it being described as enabling the creation of the ‘ internet of value ’.
The clue to this one is in the name – a blockchain is a computer file consisting of blocks of data chained together. Each ‘block’ – which can be any size depending on the type of blockchain – contains a link to the previous block – hence forming a chain.
A cryptocurrency is basically a currency which, rather than being issued and controlled by a central bank, such as US dollars or British pounds, uses an encrypted, mathematical blockchain model, as described above, to track exchange of value and ownership. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies based on the same principle have emerged.
However, it quickly became apparent that the applications of the blockchain technology could go far beyond cryptocurrency and could be extremely useful for a host of other applications, across many different industries, affecting many different aspects of our lives in business and elsewhere.
* Storing government records such as marriage certificates, business registrations, health records and much more. Governments in countries such as South Korea, Estonia and Dubai are already advancing these concepts.
* Tracking goods as they pass through a supply chain from producer to distributor to buyer, from food to diamonds. Companies like Walmart and De Beers are already using this to ensure the products in their supply chains come from the right sources.
* Other applications include enabling smart contracts, tracking patient records, digital authentication and signature systems, patent systems, distribution of locally produced energy, greater transparency in charities, frictionless real-estate transfers, and much much more…
Perhaps the most obvious is that they often require huge amounts of processing power to operate, due to the complex cryptography that must be ‘solved’ by computers in order to make the data accessible.
For example, it’s been reported that the power usage of the network used to track and verify Bitcoin transactions was around 30 terrawatts last year. By comparison, the entire country of Ireland used 24 terrawatts in the same time period. This obviously has high environmental cost, although blockchain proponents say this could be offset by moving to cleaner and renewable energy. It’s for this reason that countries like Iceland with huge supplies of geothermal energy have become hubs of bitcoin mining ( ) activity.
Another potential pitfall is that due to the current hype, blockchain technology is sometimes pushed (by those with a vested interest in selling it) as a miracle solution to any business problem. While blockchains certainly have many interesting and potentially transformative uses, they will not always be the right solution.
Blockchains can be complex, computationally intensive, and expensive to implement. On top of that, many aspects of their applications are still unregulated as policy and law makers are trying to catch up. I also believe that standards are still to be defined as many different blockchain protocols are currently competing with each other.
I hope this post helped you understand the basics of blockchains – a technology that promises to bring transformative change to many industries and government operations. To dive into more details, have a look at these posts:----




https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain

The first time I heard about blockchains was at a party where a friend of mine spent the night talking my ear off about this thing called Bitcoin and why I ought to buy some. I suspect that many others have had a similar experience. Although Bitcoin can be credited with bringing blockchains—a type of distributed digital ledger—into popular discourse, it wasn’t the progenitor of the obscure technology’s key features.
In fact, the world’s oldest blockchain predates Bitcoin by 13 years and it’s been hiding in plain sight, printed weekly in the classified section of one of the world’s most widely circulated newspapers: The New York Times.
Today, “blockchain” is treated as shorthand for the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies and digital token systems, such as Bitcoin ( ) or Ethereum ( ). Although blockchains can be used as an immutable record of financial transactions, this is far from their only use. In fact, any type of information can be added to a blockchain and in the past everything from weed strains ( ) and virtual kittens ( ) to sushi and rare art ( ) has been stored on a distributed ledger.
Blockchains, insofar as they constitute a chronological chain of hashed data, were first invented by the cryptographers Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991 and their use cases were a lot less ambitious. Instead, Haber and Stornetta envisioned the technology as a way to timestamp digital documents to verify their authenticity. As they detailed in a paper published in The Journal of Cryptology ( ) , the ability to certify when a document was created or last modified is crucial for resolving things like intellectual property rights.
As Haber and Stornetta realized, timestamping a digital document would require solving two problems. First, the data itself would have to be time stamped “so that it is impossible to change even one bit of the document without the change being apparent.” Second, it would have to be impossible to change the timestamp itself.
An obvious solution to this problem is to send the digital document to a timestamping service that would retain the document in a “digital safety deposit box,” which meets both of the criteria mentioned above. The downsides of this approach are that it would compromise the privacy of the person submitting the document and it’s possible that the document could become corrupted when it is sent or stored by the service.
The solution that Haber and Stornetta arrived at instead was to run the document through a cryptographic hashing algorithm, which produces a unique ID for the document. If even a single bit is changed in the document and it is run through the hashing algorithm again, the ID will be totally different. This idea was coupled with the related idea of digital signatures, which can be used to uniquely identify the signatory. Thus, instead of sending the entire document to a timestamping service, users could just send the cryptographic hash value, which could be signed by the service to ensure that it had been received at a certain time and wasn’t corrupted—kind of like notarizing a document IRL.
But where does The New York Times come into play? In cryptocurrencies, hashes are posted to a public ledger known as a blockchain where anybody can see for themselves that the data’s integrity is intact. Haber and Stornetta realized that the nation’s paper of record could serve a similar purpose.
What Haber and Stornetta described in their 1991 research paper is a prototypical version of the blockchains that power most cryptocurrencies today. In fact, when Satoshi Nakamoto first described Bitcoin in a 2008 whitepaper, three of the eight papers cited were written by Haber and Stornetta. When asked how he felt about being the inspiration for Bitcoin, Stornetta told the Wall Street Journal ( ) that it felt “pretty cool.”
Surety’s main product is called “AbsoluteProof” that acts as a cryptographically secure seal on digital documents. Its basic mechanism is the same described in Haber and Stornetta’s original paper. Clients use Surety’s AbsoluteProof software to create a hash of a digital document, which is then sent to Surety’s servers where it is timestamped to create a seal. This seal is a cryptographically secure unique identifier that is then returned to the software program to be stored for the customer.
At the same time, a copy of that seal and every other seal created by Surety’s customers is sent to the AbsoluteProof “universal registry database,” which is a “hash-chain” composed entirely of Surety customer seals. This creates an immutable record of all the Surety seals ever produced, so that it is impossible for the company or any malicious actor to modify a seal. But it leaves out an important part of the blockchain equation: Trustlessness. How can anyone trust that Surety’s internal records are legit?
Instead of posting customer hashes to a public digital ledger, Surety creates a unique hash value of all the new seals added to the database each week and publishes this hash value in the New York Times. The hash is placed in a small ad in the Times classified section under the heading “Notices & Lost and Found” and has appeared once a week since 1995.
According to the company, “this makes it impossible for anyone—including Surety—to backdate timestamps or validate electronic records that were not exact copies of the original.” Or almost impossible, anyway.
As Ethereum’s cofounder Vitalik Buterin joked on Twitter ( ) , if someone wanted to compromise Surety’s blockchain they could “make fake newspapers with a different chain of hashes and circulate them more widely.” Given that the New York Times has an average daily print circulation of about 570,000 copies ( ) , this would probably be the stunt of the century.
Both Haber and Stornetta left Surety over a decade ago to go back into research ( ) , but today both of them work as cryptographers on other blockchain projects. Although they never struck it rich in the brave new world of cryptocurrencies that they helped create, Haber and Stornetta are the only people in the cryptocurrency world who can claim they gave a whole new meaning to “ the paper of record ( ).”

https://www2.computerworld.com.au/article/606253/understanding-blockchain-hype-why-much-it-nothing-more-than-snake-oil-spin/

Much of what you’ve heard about the blockchain revolution is nothing but snake oil and marketing spin. This new technology has been touted as the cure-all for performing secure and trusted transactions. The mere mention of the word blockchain sends fintech and banking execs into frenzy.
Australia Post even threw its hat into the blockchain ring in early 2016 when it revealed it intended to use blockchains to store identities ( ). Australia post also recently made a submission ( ) to a Victorian government committee conducting an inquiry into electronic voting. The submission ( ) suggested that it could use ‘blockchain’ technology, but provided no detail on how or why a blockchain would improve the electronic voting process. The finance ( ) and banking sector is also investing in the technology.
The whole blockchain phenomenon started with the success of Bitcoin – a type of digital ‘cash’ that uses various cryptographic processes to secure transactions between untrusted third parties, without the need for a central authority or bank.
While the blockchain is indeed a critical part of the Bitcoin security model, it is no silver bullet. The hype surrounding the blockchain buzzword greatly exaggerates what blockchains are, and totally neglects the complex interplay of many critical technology components that work together to make Bitcoin secure.
The blockchain is a distributed ledger book of all Bitcoin transactions. This means there’s no single database of records. The distributed nature of the blockchain also helps to secure it because the Bitcoin community collectively agree on all transactions; there’s no central authority that can block or reverse payments.
Imagine it as a physical book where each page contains about ten minutes of Bitcoin transactions. After 10 minutes of transactions, the page is stamped with a special serial number (a hash), and glued permanently into the ledger book.
Everyone can be assured that the transaction list in the ledger book is secure and complete because nobody can insert, modify or delete a transaction without tearing out the page. The serial number hash makes this process very difficult because it ensures all pages are mathematically ‘locked’ (or chained) together. If any content on a previous page is modified, the serial numbers will no longer align, and everyone would know that something hinky is going on.
The only way to alter a transaction in the blockchain book is to tear out the page containing the transaction, plus all the following pages. Then alter the transaction on the original page, and then re-print every subsequent page, creating a new hash, and then gluing all of those pages back into the book. Bitcoin transactions are secure because it’s just too much work to modify them!
If I’m spending $10 at Lizza’s Pizzas, I can ‘broadcast’ a message to all Bitcoin users, requesting that they make a note of my transaction in the current block. Because the blockchain is open for inspection, Lizza can watch the blockchain until she sees my payment recorded. Furthermore, because the blockchain is secure against tampering, Lizza can be confident that the transaction is complete – there’s no way I could scam her and steal $10 worth of pizza.
If someone were to examine the blockchain after my transaction with Lizza, they’d see that her account had $10 in it that came from my account. When Lizza wants to spend $4.50 on a magazine from Nate’s News, Nate inspects the blockchain to confirm that Lizza has enough money in the account to cover the $4.50 transaction, and then watches for Lizza’s transaction in the blockchain.
The blockchain ledger book verifies the money in Nate's account through the linkage from Nate to Lizza to me (and so on). This is how all transactions are chained together; every transaction is linked to all previous transactions through the history of blocks in the blockchain.
It’s clear that even with our naïve and simple ‘blockchain book’, it’s not worth trying to scam a $10 pizza or a $4.50 magazine. The work required outweighs the value of what’s being protected. But, Bitcoin transactions come in all shapes and sizes; for example, a gambling website was sold for US$11.5 million ( ) worth of Bitcoin in 2013.
A simple blockchain is nothing more than a list of transactions that is chained or linked together using novel data structures, and some basic cryptographic principles. Anyone can make a blockchain, and create blocks. My little old laptop can make millions of blocks every second, they just wouldn’t be secure like Bitcoin’s blocks.
This is where the subtly between blockchains and security is lost. Bitcoin isn’t secure because of blockchain; it is secure because the effort and cost of subverting its blockchain is greater than the value of what’s being protected. The effort and cost that protect Bitcoin comes in the form of time, computing power and electricity.
There are many parts to the Bitcoin rulebook, and each and every part is essential to the scheme’s overall security; no single element (including the blockchain) is enough to secure Bitcoin transactions.
The Bitcoin rules are enforced by thousands of Bitcoin ‘miners’ that compete against each other to record transactions and create new blockchain entries. The miners all race to calculate a block’s hash value, which can only be found by brute force (using trial-and error).
The miners make blocks by gathering end-user transactions (my $10 pizza order for example), combining them and calculating hashes. When they discover blocks that match Bitcoin’s rules they add the block to the chain, and collect a reward.
Unlike our paper-ledger-book example, the difficulty in creating a single block is immense. It (currently) takes the collective efforts of many thousands of miners ( ) testing 1.6-million-million-million hashes per second to discover one ‘block’ every 10 minutes; they’re working at a speed that’s equivalent to 130-billion 'average' desktop computers working in parallel. These mining computers are real devices, taking up real physical space, and they collectively consume gigawatts of real power ( ).
The massive effort required to 'break Bitcoin' is what protects it. It is the reason that the blockchain is secure. As each block is added, a lot of work needs to be done; for blocks that are lower down in the chain, that work is multiplied for every subsequent block added to the chain.
Even if an attacker managed to harness gigawatts of computing power (or subvert half of the thousands of miners working to create Bitcoin blocks), the attacker would still only have a marginal advantage. The theoretical ‘51 per cent attack’ against the Bitcoin network improves the probability of controlling the ‘next’ block. But, using such an attack to re-write history (many blocks) is still almost impossible.
It’s the rules that govern the integrity of a bitcoin block that secure the blockchain. The rules ensure that the computing power required to tear out a recent block, alter a transaction, then re-create all subsequent blocks is more than any attacker and even most governments could amass.
Blockchain technology and solutions are tantalising. Without doubt, many new technologies will be built upon the blockchain concept in the years to come. But, the blockchain alone isn’t what creates security. The questions for private or proprietary blockchains are how will you protect your chain and why is a blockchain better than running an ordinary database?
The Bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It’s unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it’s time consuming and expensive. Within a private blockchain there is also no ‘race’; there’s no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.
There is also no need for a ‘51 per cent’ attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 per cent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 per cent of their network and alter transactions however you wished.

http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts

Canadian writers and researchers, Alex and Don Tapscott, authors of the new book Blockchain Revolution , explain that blockchain goes way beyond the second coming of the internet. The pair, like so many others, stumbled across blockchain via the bitcoin association, quickly realising the genie is out of the bottle.
“The first generation brought us the internet of information. The second generation, powered by blockchain, is bringing us the internet of value, a new, distributed platform that can help us reshape the world of business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better. But like the internet in the late-1980s and early-1990s, this is still early days.”
Blockchain, a distributed ledger, is an asset database that can be shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All participants within a network can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the ledger are reflected in all copies, similar to a Google doc. On the other hand, a centralized asset ledger, or clearing house, the model currently used by financial services globally,  is a list of transactions that is controlled by a single entity.
The  illustration below shows eight key areas of financial services which blockchain technology is likely to transform, ranging from making current accounts obsolete to creating new peer-to-peer (P2P) financing models.
Using the law of diffusion of innovation curve ( ) , blockchain is predicted to move past the ‘Innovators’ phase in 2016 and reach the 13,5 per cent of “early adopters” within financial services. The “tipping point”, according to Accenture, is then expected to happen in 2018 when the early majority of financial services begin to see the benefits of the early adopters and new models emerge. This growth phase is predicted by Accenture to last until 2025 when blockchain will finally become mainstream within financial services.
Global venture capital funding grew by 91 per cent in 2015 compared to the year before, or an incredible 726 per cent over the last two years. $216m was inveseted in blockchain in the first quarter of 2016 and it was the first time that blockchain and hybrid startups raised more money than bitcoin startups according to CoinDesk.
Interestingly, looking at historical venture capital spend (see earlier chart) vs future capital markets spend, it would appear that the main funding for blockchain technologies will come from outside of the financial services industry (incumbents).
When Silicon Valley Bank asked 68 UK fintech leaders to identify the greatest opportunity for fintech disruption in 2016, “infrastructure” (including blockchain and API) was the top pick according to 37 per cent of respondents.
Author of Blockchain Revolution Alex Tapscott concludes,“With blockchain technology, a world of possibilities has opened and we now have a true peer-to-peer platform that enables personal economic empowerment. We can own our identities and our personal data; we can do transactions, creating and exchanging value without powerful intermediaries acting as the arbiters of money and information.”----




https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/05/04/hype-killer-only-1-of-companies-are-using-blockchain-gartner-reports/

Global research company *Gartner* ( ) has found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.
The research, which punctures a lot of the hype about where blockchain currently is in terms of real adoption, is contained in its 2018 CIO Survey ( ). It also found that *77% of CIOs said their organisation ‘has no interest in the technology* no action planned to investigate or develop it’.
The news brings into stark contrast the huge amount of discussion about the use of blockchain technology, which *does indeed have several highly valuable and significant capabilities* , especially when there are issues around trust and data record permanence. Blockchain tech can also reduce ‘friction’ in business and legal interactions, act as a vital support for smart contracts and store the hashes of legal documents which could improve data governance and accessibility. Its use could also greatly reduce the cost of financial transactions.
Several consortia focused on law and blockchain have also developed in recent years. And of course, blockchain tech is the basis of nearly all cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, which is giving rise to some interesting legal issues in itself.
But, when it comes to regular bricks and mortar corporates actually wielding this tech, then the actual usage is small. That said, even 1% uptake could be considered as a foothold that could grow in the years ahead.
If one had surveyed law firms a few years ago, the total number of Global 100 firms using an AI system would also have been around 1%. Today dozens of law firms around the world are using AI systems in different ways. So, we should not assume that because uptake for blockchain is so far small, that it won’t grow.
David Furlonger ( ) , vice president and Gartner Fellow said of the findings: ‘This year’s Gartner CIO Survey provides factual evidence about the massively hyped state of blockchain adoption and deployment. It is critical to understand what blockchain is and what it is capable of today, compared to how it will transform companies, industries and society tomorrow.’
Furlonger added that rushing into blockchain deployments could lead organisations to ‘ *significant problems of failed innovation, wasted investment, rash decisions and even rejection of a game-changing technology* ‘.
Among 293 CIOs of organizations that are in short-term planning or have already invested in blockchain initiatives, 23 percent of CIOs said that blockchain requires the most new skills to implement of any technology area, while 18 percent said that blockchain skills are the most difficult to find. A further 14 percent indicated that blockchain requires the greatest change in the culture of the IT department, and 13 percent believed that the structure of the IT department had to change in order to implement blockchain.
Furlonger, concluded: ‘ *Blockchain technology requires understanding of, at a fundamental level, aspects of security, law, value exchange, decentralized governance, process and commercial architectures.’*
Interestingly, the company added: ‘How quickly different industry players navigate the Trough of Disillusionment ( the phase after the hype ) *will be as much about the psychological acceptance of the innovations* that blockchain brings as the technology itself.’----




http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html

Bitcoin fundamentally inverts the trust mechanism of a distributed system. Traditionally, as we see in payment and banking systems, trust is achieved through access control, by carefully vetting participants and excluding bad actors. This method of trust requires encryption, firewalls, strong authentication and careful vetting. The network requires investing trust in those gaining access.
The result is that such systems tend to be closed and small networks by necessity. By contrast, bitcoin implements a trust model of trust by computation. Trust in the network is ensured by requiring participants to demonstrate proof-of-work, by solving a computationally difficult problem. The cumulative computing power of thousands of participants, accumulated over time in a chain of increasing-difficulty proofs, ensures that no actor or even collection of actors can cheat, as they lack the computation to override the trust. As proof-of-work accumulates on the chain of highest difficulty (the blockchain), it becomes harder and harder to dispute. In bitcoin, a new proof-of-work is added every 10 minutes, with each subsequent proof making it exponentially more difficult to invalidate the previous results.
Here’s the most important effect of this new trust model of trust-by-computation: no one actor is trusted, and no one needs to be trusted. There is no central authority or trusted third party in a distributed consensus network. That fact opens up a completely new network model, as the network no longer needs to be closed, access-controlled or encrypted. Trust does not depend on excluding bad actors, as they cannot “fake” trust. They cannot pretend to be the trusted party, as there is none. They cannot steal the central keys as there are none. They cannot pull the levers of control at the core of the system, as there is no core and no levers of control.
As a result, the network can be open to all; the transactions can be broadcast on any medium, unencrypted; and applications can be added at the edge without vetting or approval. In other words, bitcoin is not just money for the Internet, it is the Internet of money — an open, de-centralized, standards-based network where innovation can occur at the edge without permission and where the network itself is simply a neutral and open transport layer.
Like the Internet and other open networks, blockchain-based crypto-currency networks are susceptible to denial-of-service and other nuisance attacks. Attacks that cannot violate the trust of the distributed asset ledger, but can clog the pipes and attempt to confuse the participants. When such attacks occur, they can cause deep concern among those who have a predilection for the security model of access control. If a bad actor gains access to a closed financial network, the results are catastrophic. Open access and trust are fundamentally at odds in a closed centralized network based on access control. Therefore, within that context, a denial of service attack or any bad actors on the network have dire consequences and signify a compromise of security and a failure of the trust model.
On bitcoin and other open crypto-currency networks, however, bad actors on the network are inconsequential because the trust model does not depend on excluding them. The bad actors are not trusted any more than any other user of the network and their access does not grant them any special rights. The trust model depends on computation and the demonstration of computation through proof-of-work. As long as good actors form the majority of the computation used for forming consensus, the bad actors cannot change the trusted ledger.
Until recently, decentralized trust at scale was not possible. Now that it is, it conflicts with most people’s understanding of the world. That’s why when you explain crypto-currencies to people, they immediately search for the central actor or authority that establishes the trust, establishes the value or has the control: “Yes, I see it is decentralized, but who runs it? Who controls it? Can’t someone take over?” These questions reveal the context of trust centralization, which is deeply embedded in our culture and our thinking. We’ve been taught to fear the bad actor and look for self-interested “trusted” individuals; we no longer have to do that.
Gradually, decentralized trust will be accepted as a new and effective trust model. We have seen this evolution of understanding before — on the Internet. The Internet led to the decentralization of authority-of-opinion, by making it possible for anyone to be a publisher without a multi-story building-sized printing press. At first, this challenged our expectations and forced us to reconsider the source of authority. If anyone could have an opinion and publish it, how can we tell which opinions are important? We had used the centralization of printing presses and distribution and the purchasing of ink by the barrel as a proxy metric of authority, to help us filter our news and opinions. Suddenly, we were thrust into a new world in which these anchors of authority were swept away and each opinion had to be judged by its merits, not the size of the publisher’s press.----




http://news.dinbits.com/2015/11/the-blockchain-technology-bandwagon-has.html

I knew this because it's been like watching a television rerun as the venture capital (VC) seedlings jumped on one bandwagon to another, scratching and clawing for new justifications of self-importance while feeding investors one snappy slogan to the next.
They have now crowned themselves Kings (and Queens) of the universe stating that " It's All About The Blockchain " and that that's what they really meant all along when millions of dollars were handed to them on a silver platter to become the next great BitCo.
This happened right about the the time when VC money was flying out the in door full force and bitcoin plummeted back down to earth. As the sky started falling, the VC seedlings were faced with watching their funding glory potentially ripped right out from under them so naturally, they groped for a shred of anything to provide continued justification for existence and that's when they stumbled upon " It's All About The Blockchain " and discarded Bitcoin. They likely found this in an old forum post.
They have since gone on to call Bitcoin things like " Blockchain's least interesting App " (Microsoft's John Farmer) *¹* and " a solution looking for a problem to solve " (Western Union's David Thompson) *²* , among other things.
Thus, initially with desperation, the attention made a massive shift from digital currency to blockchain technology , and we now have self-proclaimed pioneers armed with millions of VC dollars gracing the cover of magazines as if they had anything to do with it at all.
I hate to pop the bubble of glee and if it all sounds too familiar it's because we've *been here* and *done this* already. Just on a smaller scale and without as many VC firms jumping in. What the Bandwagon doesn't realize, or at least one of the things they don't realize, is that this is actually a rerun.
At the cataclysmic peek of this cycle, right about the time there seems to be a glimmer of hope for any of these business plans, a bulb is going to flicker. A bell is going to ding as a spark ignites. It's going to be about as subtle as a nuclear bomb hitting a city of glass as the " Blockchain Bandwagon " ultimately *"gets it"*.
This particular cycle we are in will continue its current phase for a minute since those attempting to prove bitcoin unnecessary are not going down without a fight. They either have hidden agendas or simply do not realize the importance of Bitcoin in the Blockchain of things. Just take a look at Paycoin, even that concoction is still gasping for oxygen and won't completely die.
Preston, there's only one true Blockchain ( at least in terms of global acceptance ), please refrain from standardizing it as an identifier. It's bad enough some people still call every soda a " coke ".
This " private blockchain " working with the Blockchain in reference would actually be what is called a Sidechain. Although I admittedly have not read the entire context of the material from which this quote was taken, I am fairly sure I know exactly what he meant.
Um... yes. I'm going to let you in on a little tip, that is one of the key points of it all. It's called an audit trail and enterprise software globally does this as well. Take SAP for example, the largest ERP and financial system on earth. You can flag certain things for deletion, but they do not go away, they just do not appear to the user, are not reported, and do not calculate nor are they reflected in any way. The record is still there, however, for auditing purposes.
We really do not want things that have to do with our finances being "erased". It keeps little things like theft, fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and countless other shady activity from happening.
Well then it wouldn't be the Blockchain now would it? Go forth and build whatever you guys want to on the peer-to-peer front, but don't call it anything Blockchain related. Just call it what it is, a peer-to-peer developer tool, network, or whatever you folks are fiddling with.
The Blockchain Blues You cannot build a network or " permissioned ledger " and expect the same result as the Blockchain (permissionless ledger) any more than you can guarantee a #1 global smash hit song.
Unless of course, you force feed a ledger to a group who has no choice (private permissioned ledger), such as a customer base as some banks have hinted. However, this already exists today and it's called a database. Banks already have these and they already use them.
The Blockchain is a global public network. No single entity built it and no single entity, individual, corporation, or government controls it. Its existence is due to the reward of bitcoin to the suppliers of its computational power that make it possible and the global adoption and agreement of its solutions, technology, and value of it's reward. That is why it works.
Remember Napster? It was not all that dissimilar to the Blockchain ( note the Blockchain's technology is very different, but it is based on the same concept ), music played the role of Bitcoin and the Napster software along with shared hard drives was similar to the Blockchain. It made up a peer-to-peer network and why did people lend drive space and decide to make this a possibility on earth? *Free music*. When something is given, something is expected in return.
( ) How much do you want to bet that if there is a Blockchain without Bitcoin the same people promoting this idea stand to make a little money? Of course they do, and of course they all wish they had built the Blockchain. That way instead of Bitcoin, it would all be money going into their pockets instead of the global network of contributors who make it possible.
As this all moves forward, corporations will eventually have Blockchain developers on every IT team. IT support teams will install the latest *[developer]* IDE with a Blockchain SDK as standard issue for their development machines. The developers themselves, of course, will uninstall this once they manage to get " admin rights ", and put something that actually works well in place to use.
Enterprise implementations will implement various tools to patch in the Blockchain for business from the enterprise software giants who come up with genius level marketing schemes to label their integration to the very technology they were slow to get up to speed on ... " innovative ".
Companies like Accenture will be paid monumental amounts of money to assign 42 exploratory consultants together and plagiarize themselves up a shiny new explanatory document that could have otherwise been achieved with a sentence from someone who actually knew the answer.
Finally, once banks and big business pretty much bastardize any shred of originality and a standards team publishes a be-all-end-all format for all of the world to comply with, the average Joe will get involved.
The average Joe phase will likely be much more like the original episode than the current one, but *A.J.* will have more tools, more documentation, and the Google apparatus will deliver information about the inner-workings of the Blockchain in English rather than JSON.
For now, however, the current cycle is still in progress. Right now we're in the the " hey we can make AltCoins " phase of this cycle where you have companies like itBit making " BankChain " (not the SAP Bankchain , the itBit AltCoin that really isn't an AltCoin at all and sounds more like a database application) and others tinkering around with the Blockchain realizing you can do more than just send bitcoins. Go figure. We tried to tell you guys this years ago.
Once this happens and they realize the importance of Bitcoin's role in the grand scheme of things, just like they recently realized the importance of the Blockchain, some interesting things are going to happen.
I suppose there is something to be said for etymology and the " 3rd time's a charm ", meaning the third endeavor is the most likely to succeed. It seems how things unfold more often than not and will certainly be applicable with the " bandwagon ".
How do I know all of this this? Is it because of some peculiar extraordinary psychic abilities? Are my forecasting skills beyond that of trained AI models and complex computer forecasting systems? Am I just that damn good?

https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959

The report from research firm GlobalData, “ Blockchain – Thematic Research ( ) ” [fee required], argues that the new technology’s bubble “will burst in the next two years [and] will have lost much of its gloss by 2025.” Summarizing blockchain as “awash with hype, but with a powerful core value proposition” of distributed ledger tech, the report was researched over the last 18 months and involved interviews with about a hundred organizations.
For instance, he said, many of the radical reductions in costs that blockchain advocates claim are actually because old business processes are being dramatically streamlined, such as eliminating all the middlemen commonly required to record transactions, and not because of blockchain itself.
In fact, blockchain tech is often extremely computer- and energy-intensive and processes transactions very slowly. A single bitcoin transaction — the original use for blockchain tech — requires about 5,000 times more energy than a single Visa transaction, the report says, because of the required consensus approvals and the duplication of data.
Blockchain’s difficult-to-change recording of data is usually seen as a benefit, but that data is often only transactional. The “meat” of the data — such as medical histories or intellectual property — is often stored in an encrypted form in conventional databases or other storage repositories, with the blockchain itself acting as a gate and a pointer.
One key reason for that, Barnett pointed out, is that the entire blockchain is typically replicated in each node held by each participant, which would require enormous storage and processing power if it had to contain content as well as transactions or pointers.
Another reason content is often stored on conventional databases is because of the newly implemented General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ( ) ), which stipulates that vendors handling personal data for EU citizens must allow the permanent deletion of personal data if so requested.
Then there’s the issue of trust. Advocates define blockchain as a decentralized system that guarantees the validity of entries because they are typically verified by a consensus of all participants, a kind of trust without a central authority.
This can be useful, for instance, in tracking the provenance of products along a supply chain. A marketer, for instance, could audit the route taken by rare cocoa beans, from their harvesting in the jungles of Peru to their passages via train, truck and cargo ship, and eventually into a chocolate bar offered for sale in Chicago.
But, as Barnett points out, there’s the obvious fact that the blockchain consensus only verifies the transactional details of these cocoa beans — this entry was made on July 16 by such-and-such trader, for instance. The blockchain consensus can’t verify that these particular cocoa beans were actually found growing wild in the Amazon. And, he noted, there are other effective ways to verify the provenance of products without employing blockchain.
One of the most commonly cited values of blockchain tech is its use of smart contracts ( ) , first implemented with the second generation of blockchain, Ethereum. Smart contracts are self-fulfilling agreements embodied in software code, such as the release of payment once an ad has been displayed on an agreed-upon website.
Besides, he said, smart contracts add “developers to a room that already has lawyers in it, the two kinds of people most likely to [screw] something up.” As the complexity of the agreement increases, he said, the smart contract’s key attribute — triggering action when machine-verifiable terms are completed — loses its appeal.
Smart contracts are not very smart, he said, since they are based entirely on agreements about whether a certain event is triggered. If someone delivers a pound of prime steak and the smart contract uses that trigger to deliver payment, he said, there is no provision to verify that this is actually steak and not horsemeat. The smart contract needs to verify the satisfied condition through digital means to be automatic, but digital verification has its limitations in this analog world.
“Almost every single technical problem has more than one technical solution,” he added, and the use cases for blockchain are no exceptions. The only possible exception where blockchain is the only feasible solution, he said, is cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. This was where blockchain was born, as a solution providing automatic consensus to make sure that a bitcoin can be spent only once.
One key use case category for distributed ledgers, the report says, is cross-border trading, where a distributed ledger that does not require a central authority can be useful. These situations include financial instrument trading, land registries, settlement for gold bullion trading, supply chain audits or international trade settlements.

Blockchain isn't a household buzzword, like the cloud or the Internet of Things. It's not an in-your-face innovation you can see and touch as easily as a smartphone or a package from Amazon. But in a world where anyone can edit a Wikipedia entry, blockchain is the answer to a question we've been asking since the dawn of the internet age: How can we collectively trust what happens online?
Every year we run more of our lives—more core functions of our governments, economies, and societies—on the internet. We do our banking online. We shop online ( ). We log into apps and services that make up our digital selves and send information back and forth. Think of blockchain as a historical fabric underneath recording everything that happens—every digital transaction; exchange of value, goods and services; or private data—exactly as it occurs. Then the chain stitches that data into encrypted blocks that can never be modified and scatters the pieces across a worldwide network of distributed computers or "nodes."
( '375', '500') ) Think about a blockchain as a distributed database that maintains a shared list of records. These records are called blocks, and each encrypted block of code contains the history of every block that came before it with timestamped transaction data down to the second. In effect, you know, chaining those blocks together. Hence blockchain.
A blockchain is made up of two primary components: a decentralized network facilitating and verifying transactions, and the immutable ledger that network maintains. Everyone in the network can see this shared transaction ledger, but there is no single point of failure from which records or digital assets can be hacked or corrupted. Because of that decentralized trust, there's also no one organization controlling that data, be it a big bank or a tech giant like Facebook or Google. No third-parties serving as the gatekeepers of the internet. The power of blockchain's distributed ledger technology has applications across every kind of digital record and transaction, and we're already beginning to see major industries leaning into the shift.
First up are the big banks and tech giants ( ). Big business will always drive innovation, and the rise of blockchain-based smart contracts (read on for a deeper explanation) turns blockchain into a middleman to execute all manner of complex business deals, legal agreements, and automated exchanges of data. Companies such as Microsoft and IBM are using their cloud infrastructure to build custom blockchains ( ) for customers and experiment with their own use cases, like building a worldwide food safety network ( ) of manufacturers and retailers. On the academic side, researchers are exploring blockchain applications for projects ranging from digital identity to medical and insurance records.
At the same time, dozens of startups are using the technology for everything from global payments to music sharing, from tracking diamond sales to the legal marijuana industry ( ). That's why blockchain's potential is so vast: When it comes to digital assets and transactions, you can put absolutely anything on a blockchain. A host of economic, legal, regulatory, and technological hurdles must be scaled before we see widespread adoption of blockchain technology, but first movers are making incredible strides. Within the next handful of years, large swaths of your digital life may begin to run atop a blockchain foundation—and you may not even realize it.
Blockchain is the data structure that allows Bitcoin (BTC) and other up-and-coming cryptocurrencies such as Ether (ETH) to thrive through a combination of decentralized encryption, anonymity, immutability, and global scale. It's the not-so-secret weapon behind the cryptocurrency's rise, and to explain how blockchain came to be, we have to begin briefly with the legacy of Bitcoin.
On Oct. 31, 2008, Bitcoin founder and still-mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) published his famous white paper ( ) introducing the concept of a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system he called Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain launched a few months later on Jan. 3, 2009.
For Jeff Garzik, it started the way many a buzzy idea in the tech community has over the years: with a post on "news for nerds" and OG tech aggregator Slashdot.org. Garzik is the CEO and cofounder of enterprise blockchain startup Bloq, but has spent years as a Bitcoin core developer. He was also recently elected to the Board of Directors of The Linux Foundation (as the first member with a blockchain and cryptocurrency background).
In July 2010, Garzik was working on Linux at enterprise software company Red Hat when what he calls "The Great Slashdotting" occurred. One viral post ( ) introduced programmers, investors, and tech nerd-dom at large to the concept of Bitcoin, and by extension, to blockchain. Garzik had always been fascinated with the goal of making seamless digital payments work on a global scale and across borders. When he realized how Bitcoin's underlying technology worked, he said it "knocked him on his bum."
"I had already thought to myself about how someone might create a decentralized version of PayPal. When Elon [Musk] and Peter Thiel and the other founders created PayPal, they had this vision of a global ledger that could easily and cheaply add entries between users like a database entry. That vision met reality with banking laws and cross-border friction, with legal hurdles and regulations not only in the U.S. but around the world. It made that kind of decentralized global currency impossible, or so we thought.
"Bitcoin turned all of that on its head," Garzik went on. "From an engineering perspective, the proof of work was this very elegant way to elect a leader, the block creator, in this decentralized and potentially adversarial system. Bitcoin layered on top of that engineering a set of economic and game-theory incentives that paid you in the script of the system itself, creating this virtuous cycle where it's in your best economic interest to to follow the consensus rules and create the longest, strongest chain possible. I didn't realize until that post on that day how elegantly it could be done."
It's important to understand why Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same thing. In Garzik's TEDx Talk ( ) (above), he described Bitcoin as "an organism." It has layers, like other software. On top of the public Bitcoin blockchain sits billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, but beneath that is a ledger just like any other blockchain. That decentralized ledger technology, and its myriad potential uses for securely transferring data and digital assets over the internet, is the subject of this feature. For a deeper dive into the nuances of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and the complex political dynamics at work in those communities, check out our explainer on why blockchains fork ( ).
Garzik said Bitcoin was just the first demo application of what blockchain can do. In this case, it built a monetary revolution on the back of an all-seeing ledger, one that's everywhere and nowhere at once, and gave the cryptocurrency its power.
People often get bogged down in technological complexity when trying to understand blockchain, but the basic concept is a simple and universal one. We have facts and information we don't want accessed, copied, or tampered with, but on the internet, there's always a chance it could be hacked or modified. Blockchain gives us a constant—a bedrock we know won't change once we put something on it and where a transaction will be verified only if it follows the rules.
The Nakamoto white paper explains the basics ( ) of "mining" data into a block, then using a hash (a time-stamped link) to chain those blocks together across a decentralized network of "nodes" that verify each and every transaction. The other key innovation in the white paper is using what's known as the proof-of-work (PoW) model to create distributed "trustless" consensus and solve the double-spend problem (ensuring cryptocurrency isn't spent more than once).
A "trustless system" doesn't mean it's a system you can't trust. Quite the opposite. Because the blockchain verifies each transaction through PoW, this means no trust is required between participants in a transaction. Where does the proof-of-work come from? The miners. A P2P network of Bitcoin "miners" generates PoW as they hash blocks together, verifying transactions that then go into the ledger.
In the 2016 book Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World, authors Don and Alex Tapscott explain Nakamoto's Bitcoin model about as succinctly as one can:
Note that nothing is completely unhackable, particularly when you don't use it as intended. Blockchain's security works not only because it's encrypted but also because it's also decentralized. Victims of the biggest blockchain breaches and cryptocurrency heists ( Mt. Gox ( ) in 2014 and Bitfinex ( ) in 2016) were targeted and pilfered clean because they tried to centralize a decentralized system. Ethereum ( ) has seen a number of hacks and security incidents as well. Last year's DAO hack ( ) was traced to exploited loopholes in smart contracts written atop an established blockchain. More recently South Korea's largest Ethereum exchange was hacked, and an Israeli startup's initial coin offering (ICO) was hijacked when their website was hacked.
These issues all stemmed from vulnerabilities in systems connected to the blockchain, not within the blockchain itself. Blockchain's underlying security and encryption model is a sound one. How that security is executed is a story for another feature ( ).
So we've explained how the network functions and how security works, but how do the blocks actually connect to one another? Why does a blockchain get stronger the longer it gets? Where does the immutability come in? The Tapscotts' explanation continues:
The concept of immutability is maybe the most crucial to understand when trying to wrap your head around blockchain and why it's important. An object that once created can never be changed has infinite value in our editable, ephemeral digital world.
Harking back to the "strength in numbers" principle, the more nodes a blockchain is distributed over, the stronger and more trusted it becomes. It's verification on top of verification to infinity. Bloq's Garzik talked about how the network effect ( ) of blockchain is key to its immutability, and why it's the reason the public Bitcoin blockchain is still the most popular and trusted blockchain out there:
"The immutability factor is very much dependent on the network effect," said Garzik. "You see that with Bitcoin very specifically. The cost of creating a new digital asset is essentially zero. Therefore you have to demonstrate an overwhelming amount of value in overcoming that network effect if you want to convince someone to switch away from the Bitcoin blockchain, which not only has a good track record but high security value from a technical perspective. Security and immutability are a direct function of the economics—how much investment there is in the ecosystem, and how many people are using it."
Once you understand what a blockchain is and how it works, the next question an everyday tech user would have is how it'll affect them. If you're not a business that's building a blockchain-based product or service, why should you care? As Don Tapscott explained it in Blockchain Revolution and in a 2016 TED Talk ( ) of his own, it's because blockchain brings us from the Internet of information into the "Internet of value." From his TED talk:
If you think of blockchain as an operating system for data, then smart contracts are its killer app. Smart contracts add complex logic and rules atop a blockchain that can automate traditional contract management ( ) and digitize the world around us the same way apps like Uber are automating away the need to wave your hand in the air to hail a cab.
You can't talk about the future of blockchain without explaining the role smart contracts will play ( ). If the world is going to run on blockchain, much of it will rely on smart contracts to execute the data exchanges and program in rules to govern how each code-triggered agreement works. Smart contracts are also a flexible mechanism that can serve as the blockchain middleman for all manner of agreements and data exchanges, down to something as simple as verifying someone's identity to ensure they're of legal drinking age.
( '300', '333') ) "Think about getting carded at a bar," said Jerry Cuomo, Vice President of Blockchain Technologies at IBM. "From an identity perspective, I can imagine a blockchain managing verification of a citizen's identity. A smart contract could ensure something like my daughter going out for her 21st birthday and the bouncer only being able to see her age, not her address. Blockchain could set up a centralized identity verification system that could make the world safer for dads like myself."
Identity management ( ) is an application to watch, but the list goes on and on. The Chamber of Digital Commerce, the leading trade association that represents the blockchain industry, runs the Smart Contracts Alliance. The Chamber and Alliance (in collaboration with Deloitte) released a white paper ( ) entitled "Smart Contracts: 12 Uses Cases for Business & Beyond" detailing a dozen broad areas and industries where smart contracts could change the game.
In a broad legal sense, smart contracts provide what Bloq's Garzik calls ""adjudication-as-a-service:" a real-time version of the court system that, for finance scenarios, can cut time on deal closings, banking and securities transactions, and even global trade finance from weeks or months to days, hours, or minutes. On the digital identity front, the white paper calls smart contracts a "user-centered Internet for individuals" giving users control over the data, digital assets, and online reputation associated with them. Blockchain also affords the ability to decide what personal data is and isn't shared with businesses—the same concept behind the driver's license analogy.
Beyond identity, the white paper also talks about how smart contracts can be applied to getting a mortgage and instantaneously processing auto-insurance claims. In the medical research field, they can serve as a mechanism to ensure better patient privacy in clinical trials while promoting more open data-sharing in the cancer research community. Another of the paper's use cases is land titling. Countries around the world, including Ghana, Georgia, and Honduras, that are typically rife with property fraud and land disputes are already implementing smart contracts to facilitate property transfers and land ownership.
Real-world smart contracts are also gaining traction in a few other interesting ways. Everledger ( ) is a blockchain-based fraud-detection system for valuable physical assets, particularly jewelry and diamonds. It uses a hybrid blockchain that combines the Bitcoin blockchain with its own private blockchain to build smart contracts that certify physical diamonds. It combats the sale of conflict diamonds by keeping a transaction history for each gem.
"Everledger takes a diamond or a piece of art and hashes it to the blockchain," said MIT's Forde. "For something like a diamond ring, Everledger takes an image of it—like a unique diamond fingerprint—which can then be scanned against the blockchain to verify it's the same one."
Once you open the door of tracking and manage physical assets ( ) , smart contracts can tackle the whole supply chain. IBM and Walmart are even partnering in China to track the movement of pork (seriously) to keep people from eating tainted meat.
( '300', '275') ) You can also use smart contracts for digital content such as music. Mycelia ( ) , a "collective of creatives, professionals and lovers of music" founded by musician Imogen Heap, is a blockchain-based protective ecosystem pushing smart contracts as a way for musicians to share free-trade music and to ensure the profits go back to the artists.
Mycelia is an example of blockchain and smart contracts' potential for digital rights management (DRM). Smart contracts in digital music files or other copyrighted material might enable artists to better sell directly to consumers without the need for labels, lawyers, or accountants, with royalties paid out automatically.
A sleeping giant in this conversation is the effect smart contracts could have on the Internet of Things. Think about all the data smart devices collect. Fitness trackers collect your body's vital statistics. Thermostats collect temperature data. Alexa has records of every search and request you've ever asked of her. If the IoT ran on a blockchain, and smart contracts governed that real-time data, it could create a whole new class of lending and other usage-based agreements, according to Erin Fonte, Head of the Financial Services Regulatory and Compliance Practice Group at corporate law firm Dykema.
"If you had smart and connected cars that could report back actual usage stats, you could tie pricing into real-time usage and have it automatically adjust over the length of your vehicle lease and financing," said Fonte.
Think about how connected devices enable mobile payments without traditional credit card swiping at the point of sale ( ). Instead of swiping your card at a terminal, you touch a thumb to your iPhone to use Apple Pay. The automated payment system is authenticating individuals and providing verifiable legal proof of transaction authorization, just as a smart contract using those same two permissions—authorization and permission—in an IoT device can make a transaction legally enforceable against a buyer or seller, which is particularly applicable in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
"Amazon Dash buttons are a prime example," said Fonte. "It's one little branded button you stick in your house, and then you don't have to log onto Amazon to reorder. Just press the button, and it repeats its last order. For connected homes and cars, blockchain's ability to monitor, collect, and make sense of data for transactions will drive the ability for humans to authorize machines to carry out activities like this as agents. The next step is that you don't need a button. Manufacturers will create customer and end-user [smart contract] agreements on the back end. "Your washing machine will have that feature built into the product itself."
Blockchain is still in its infancy. Before we see widespread adoption on the scale the technology is capable of, a lot needs to happen. We must have buy-in from government (which in the U.S. means working state-by-state on policies and legislation). The industry has to clear a labyrinth of legal and regulatory hurdles before blockchain can power better banking, identity, records, or anything else requiring official documentation that now runs on legacy government systems or even (still) on paper.
We also need open standards to tie the blockchain industry together. The most prominent coalition working to make that happen is the Hyperledger project. Hyperledger is an open-source initiative to create an open, standardized, and enterprise-grade distributed ledger framework and code base to be used across industries. Overseen by The Linux Foundation, its members include tech companies (Cisco, IBM, Intel, Red Hat, Samsung, VMware, and more), big banks (JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and so on), blockchain startups such as Bloq, and a host of others ( ). The project recently released the first production-ready version of Hyperledger Fabric ( ) as a foundation for building blockchain apps. Big blockhain players like Microsoft are beginning to get into the standardization game as well, with Redmond releasing its own Coco Framework ( ) to work with existing protocols and build more powerful governance and data confidentiality into private blockchains.
"The Linux Foundation is the key layer of governance for shepherding and maturing open-source products," said Garzik. "There are many blockchain peddlers out in the market right now, and one of the biggest pain points we see is incompatibility; a large bank that has merged 10 businesses over the past decade and has a lot of halfway-compatible internal legacy systems. That's where the foundation and Hyperledger really come to the fore. As young as the blockchain industry is, the kind of technical standards-making we need for interoperability has so far been absent."
Another important Hyperledger member is R3 ( ) , the wealthy elephant in the room when it comes to blockchain standardization. R3 is a consortium dedicated to research and development of advanced distributed ledger technologies for global financial markets. It also represents most of the biggest banks and financial institutions on the planet: Barclays, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Bank of America, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and a number of others.
We're already beginning to see the kind of blockchain-based international trading R3 is after. Last fall, the first cross-border transaction between banks using multiple blockchain applications took place between the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo, resulting in a shipment of cotton to China from the United States. R3 is also becoming an example of how difficult standardizing blockchain can be. Goldman Sachs and Santander both left R3 in late 2016 in the midst of big-bank jockeying over control of a new funding round for the consortium. R3 is doing just fine, though. The consortium announced a new $107 round of funding in May.
As Ethereum and the value of the Ether currency have exploded in popularity in the past year, standardization efforts have emerged around its blockchain platform as well. The membership of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance ( ) has amassed more than 150 enterprise organizations since its launch in February, spanning tech corporations, banks and financial institutions, blockchain and cryptocurrency startups, industries such as healthcare and energy, and even a few governments.
Few know the challenge of pushing for blockchain adoption better than Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The Chamber is currently engaged in lobbying and advocacy efforts in 14 states and counting. In North Carolina, the chamber's efforts helped pass the North Carolina Money Transmitter Act in July 2016, which updates the state's existing laws to include a defined "virtual currency."
Boring said the law is a big win for blockchain and digital currency but still only a drop in the bucket of patchwork state-by-state regulations and the even more muddled web of federal agencies. In the past year, Chamber representatives have testified at cryptocurrency regulation hearings in New Hampshire, lobbied regulatory proposals in New York and Washington states, and made official comments on virtual currency acts and regulatory frameworks from the Uniform Law Commission and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).
"How is digital currency supposed to be regulated? This is a huge national debate around how states can effectively regulate digital currency and money transmission, and every state has its own opinion and a completely different way of doing things," explained Boring. "New York says businesses need a separate digital currency license to operate in the state. North Carolina said that's way too complicated and regulatory overkill, and decided instead to amend their existing money transmission laws to incorporate digital currency. We prefer the latter approach."
Yet as difficult as overcoming entrenched legacy systems and regulations can be, we already have a blueprint of how it can be done. Over the past two years, the state of Delaware has shown how governments can legislate, sanction, adopt, and implement blockchain technology to power core services.
As with much of the legislation, regulation, and business drivers behind blockchain, it starts with fintech (financial technology). More than a million companies and 66 percent of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated and legally headquartered in Delaware, in large part because of the state's largest export: uncertified shares (meaning the ability to own shares in a company without holding the actual stock certificate). In partnership with blockchain fintech company Symbiont ( ) , the Delaware Blockchain Initiative announced in 2016 will completely automate stock issuance and recordkeeping on a blockchain ledger.
'Before the Delaware Blockchain Initiative, there was no technological solution to support digital representation of share ownership," explained Symbiont CEO Mark Smith. "From what can only be described as a forward-thinking agenda from the state, they embraced that they could reimagine how to deliver their marquee service on a distributed ledger, using Symbiont's technology to create a new type of share and change the way a corporation works from now into the foreseeable future."
A little finance background: The genesis moment of a private equity ( ) is when you incorporate a company. As Smith explained, now companies will have the ability to carry that equity all the way from incorporation up to and including an initial public offering (85 percent of IPOs happen in Delaware), all via the blockchain, with complete financial transparency for state lawyers and regulatory agencies. The entire process will run automatically on smart contracts.
Even greater implications lie in what the Delaware Blockchain Initiative is doing beyond digital shares. At the Consensus blockchain technology summit this past year, Delaware Governor Jack Markell gave a keynote speech ( ) announcing the initiative and laying out a blockchain roadmap for the next five years, including a new joint effort with Symbiont to digitize and store the entire Delaware Public Archives on a blockchain ledger in 2017.
Symbiont's Smith, who is also a co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce's Smart Contracts Alliance, explained how Delaware is building cryptographic document control that will ultimately overhaul how city, county, and state municipalities share information that in many cases still exists on paper in filing cabinets. Smith's first conversation with Delaware officials was in October 2015, and between then and now, the state has gone from knowing nothing about blockchain to embracing it in its biggest export and mobilizing to push new legislation and initiatives around it.
"The state is completely reimagining how it stores and distributes public records to its citizens. Land and property titling, licensing, birth and death certificates, automobile VIN numbers, heavy machinery and luxury good registrations, all these things are being incorporated into Symbiont's technology stack behind the Delaware blockchain," said Smith. "Distributed ledger technology is not a silver bullet—it's not going to solve every problem—but it does solve some very big ones.
"When [Delaware] Governor Markell came out publicly announcing the initiative, he said he wanted to challenge us to use this powerful technology," Smith continued. "Delaware should serve as a blueprint for many other states, each of which could operate a node right next to Delaware and build critical mass and momentum from a government perspective that could lead to other nations joining in."
The change blockchain represents to our digital world is tectonic. Blockchain is broad and coming to the fore on such a massive scale that explaining it often falls back on the abstract, rather than grounding it in the kind of foundational change the technology will have on the culture of how we interact online.
The Web 1.0 was a read-only Internet of static web pages. Web 2.0 ( ) , where we are now, added dynamic user-generated content and the rise of social media. Web 3.0 has many definitions, but one of the most popular is that of connective intelligence: where the next generation of applications, data, concepts, and people are connected by an unmediated fabric where you don't need a trust broker like a bank or tech company in the middle to ensure privacy and security. In blockchain, we finally have the technology to power Web 3.0.
"The first four decades of the Internet brought us email, the World Wide Web, dot-coms, social media, the mobile web, Big Data, cloud computing, and the early days of the Internet of Things," the Tapscotts write in Blockchain Revolution. Through that lens, MIT's Brian Forde said, we can understand where blockchain fits into our lives.
"People have forgotten how powerful it is not to have to worry about what email app you use. When I email you, it doesn't matter if you're using Gmail or Outlook or Yahoo—you just give me your email address and go. Now think about sending money today. If I want to send you $20, we're going to play a game of 20 questions. Do you have PayPal? How about Venmo?" said Forde.
"Imagine if we still chose our cell phone carriers and ISPs based on whether your friends and family were using Sprint or AT&T," Forde went on. "That's still the world we live in today for most digital services. You joined Facebook because your friends did. You're not going to sign up with a new payments startup if your friends are all on PayPal. It's going to be incredibly powerful for consumers to have more choice when everything running on blockchain just works."
Blockchain is taking root within a wide swath of industries. To discover which ones, all you need to do is follow the money. A Deloitte survey ( ) released in December 2016 polled blockchain-knowledgeable senior executives at organizations with $500 million or more in annual revenue. Of the 308 respondents, 28 percent reported that their companies have already invested $5 million or more in blockchain technology, with 10 percent investing $10 million or more. Although the fintech industry was early to show interest in blockchain and accounts for a significant amount of investment and activity, the survey revealed other industries aggressively pursuing blockchain.
Within the consumer products and manufacturing industry, 42 percent of respondents said they're planning to invest $5 million or more in 2017, compared to 27 percent in the media and telecoms industry, and 23 percent in financial services. Put together, 30 percent of consumer manufacturing and industry respondents said their companies have already deployed blockchain into production.
Yet the industry the Deloitte report identifies with the most aggressive deployment plans is healthcare and life sciences: 35 percent of respondents in that industry say their companies plan to deploy blockchain in production within the next calendar year. When you look at some of the blockchain healthcare initiatives already out there, that stat starts to make a lot of sense.
One exciting project Forde pointed to is MedRec ( ) , an MIT initiative creating a blockchain to serve as a digital family history of medical records.Think about sitting down in a doctor's office and being asked your family medical history for a certain illness. You might, off the top of your head, have no idea of the answer. But with MedRec blockchain, families and medical providers can create a shared medical history that can be passed from generation to generation.
"With medical records, we're all asked that question: Is there any family history of this? The answer is usually 'I don't know,'" said Forde. "What's interesting here, as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), we now have this mandate for electronic health records, and the government subsidizes doctors to get those records. But that data is still siloed. There needs to be a technology or protocol allowing all that data to be shared, regardless of provider. MedRec helps facilitate that. It's not just about the interoperability of your data; it's also about the protection of your data from fraud."
Forde said the project is also evolving as a way for hospitals and medical practices to interface with consumer tech. Think about all the real-time health data collected by wearables and fitness trackers and even apps like Apple Health. MedRec is exploring the possibility of using blockchain to give doctors and hospitals access to that data, if you consent.
"You've got Fitbit, Apple Watch, all this consumer tech collecting data on your blood pressure, heart rate, etc," said Forde. "Then you go to the hospital or your doctor and they have their own system. You see the allergist and they've got their own system, and none of it is connected. If there's no interoperability between any of these systems, how are you going to get the best possible care?"
The federal government recognizes blockchain's potential for health care, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is already doing something about it. The HHS Blockchain Challenge ( ) gathered more than 70 submissions of academic papers on blockchain usage in health IT and health-related research, announcing 15 winners this past September spanning organizations including Deloitte, IBM, MIT (MedRec was one of the winners), and The Mayo Clinic. The winners, who presented to the HHS for possible development and implementation, proposed blockchain solutions for everything from health insurance claims and payments to data interoperability and Medicaid applications. The Chamber of Digital Commerce, which participated in the challenge, sees blockchain's potential to transform healthcare and beyond.
"HHS received so many amazing ideas," said the Chamber's Boring. "In the healthcare industry, we are seeing a huge influx of interest and a lot of major problems blockchain is addressing, from patient privacy and electronic health records to tracking pharmaceuticals and doctor shopping. Blockchain technology is also extremely powerful when it comes to victims of identity theft. Blockchain provides for an unprecedented level of privacy and security that can be leveraged to confirm your digital identity as we do more and more of our daily activities online."
That notion of identity is key. Through the digital "wallet" a blockchain creates around not only virtual money but the pieces of data that make up your identity, blockchain will act as a gatekeeper of sorts to how we interact with the digital world. Blockchain-based identity is being explored and experimented with in a host of ways, from the IoT governance model to more secure voting, and in the case of Blocksafe ( ) , as a way to reduce gun violence by securing firearms with "smart locks."
"These digital wallets will become control centers," explained Bloq's Garzik." In a multi-chain, multi-network world, you wind up with a digital experience that secures itself with several factors of authentication.Then once [the blockchain verifies] that I'm Jeff, it'll say things like, 'Do you want to send your autonomous car from home over to your wife's office? Do you want to unlock the door for a guest coming over? Are you allowed to drink at this bar? Are you licensed to carry a gun?'"
One of the futures envisioned in Blockchain Revolution is a "second era of democracy": one in which blockchain technology can create the conditions for fair, secure, and convenient digital voting that galvanizes the citizenry by removing so many of the systemic voting roadblocks plaguing our current system. Putting democracy on a blockchain is complicated, but startups including Follow My Vote ( ) and Settlemint ( ) are already laying out frameworks centered around blockchain-based tokens serving as votes, dropped in digital wallets for each candidate.
At a time in America when the integrity of our voting process is under intense scrutiny, blockchain—as with every manifestation of the technology laid out in this feature—could provide a new way forward. The book points to a 2015 paper published by the University of Athens introducing DEMOS, an end-to-end e-voting system, and an organization and "political app" in Australia called Flux ( ) that's already using blockchain voting to try to transform the political process. When I spoke to Don Tapscott for this story, he discussed how the opportunity to "reinvent democracy" speaks to the universal power of what blockchain can do.
"Young people didn't vote in [the 2016 presidential] election because they're not engaged. We urgently need to fix this. In the book, we argue for a new era of democracy based on accountability, smart contracts, and a culture of public deliberation and active citizenship enabled by the blockchain," said Tapscott. "We should move many things onto blockchains. I think governments could move toward creating a blockchain-based identity. Think about your health records, your academic records, your citizenship and ability to vote, all unified and facilitated via blockchain. As a voter, you need 100 percent assurance that your vote was counted for the person whom you voted, that it can't be reallocated, and that it was private. In e-voting, only blockchains can guarantee that level of assurance.
"But it goes far beyond e-voting," Tapscott continued. "Leaders could come to power with a smart contract where they're accountable to citizens and have to abide by the terms of the contract. There are opportunities everywhere. Look at the different hats we all wear every day. You're a parent, a consumer, a listener of music, an employee, a voter, a citizen. Blockchain affects you in every way."

A notice to people using Bitcoin for illicit purposes: you can run, but it’s getting a lot harder to hide. Law enforcement officials are using Bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain, to follow the digital money and track down suspected criminals using it.
As the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has helped fuel the rise of ransomware attacks—extortion schemes, like the recent WannaCry cyberattack ( ) , in which hackers hold the contents of a victim’s computer hostage until they get paid. Criminals can use Bitcoin to collect ransoms easily and without having to reveal their identities. The currency has also been associated with online drug sales, money laundering, and sex trafficking.
But while Bitcoin users can withhold their identities, they can’t avoid revealing other information that can be useful to investigators. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on its blockchain, a publicly accessible record of all transactions made using the currency. Blockchains “provide a really useful source of truth,” says Jonathan Levin, cofounder of Chainalysis ( ) , which develops software tools for analyzing blockchain data. Its products can help investigators draw inferences about how people are using the currency.
Chainalysis combines its analysis with other publicly available information to identify users through the unique strings of numbers they use on the blockchain, called addresses, and then map how they move funds around. This technique can be used to do things like identify the Bitcoin exchanges where the users of a gambling site are converting their bitcoins into dollars (see “ Mapping the Bitcoin Economy Could Reveal Users’ Identities ( ) ”).
Chainalysis’s tools are clearly valuable to criminal investigators. Since 2015, the company has supported investigations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Europol. In most cases, says Levin, investigators turn to Chainalysis when they already have some kind of lead, like a Bitcoin address they found among a suspect’s possessions. If they can determine that a suspect is using a particular exchange, they can use a court order get more information from that exchange.
The government is also interested tracking the flow of funds on the blockchain to determine whether merchants that accept Bitcoin are reporting it and paying proper taxes, says Danny Yang, founder of BlockSeer ( ) , which also develops Blockchain analytics tools and supports law enforcement investigations.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are becoming customers of analytics firms too. In many places it’s unclear the degree to which exchanges are required by law to know their customers and make sure they aren’t laundering money, as is required of traditional banks. But it’s difficult for exchanges to open bank accounts if they don’t understand who their customers are. And if the government is able to see that criminals are using certain exchanges, the exchanges want to be able to see that too, says Yang.
The news isn’t all good for law enforcement, though. There are ways to confuse investigators, such as using so-called mixing services, which take bitcoins from many users and mix them up before sending them back out to different addresses at different times. More important, some newer cryptocurrencies, prominently Zcash and Monero, are designed to conceal the information that Chainalysis, BlockSeer, and others use to follow the money.
Savvy criminals are already migrating to these untraceable systems. Last month, Chainalysis confirmed that WannaCry hackers were able to convert a portion of their ransom payouts from Bitcoin to Monero before the service they were using blacklisted their addresses.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market is sliding, with a host of alternative digital coins gaining ground as developers race to create digital cash that can gain a footing in mainstream commerce and finance.
Every transaction involving Monero obscures the digital addresses of the senders and receivers, as well as the value of the transaction. That offers users near-total anonymity, allowing them to instantaneously send digital cash without leaving any clues.
When Norwegian police earlier this year gave details of the kidnapping of the wife of a wealthy businessman, they said the family had demanded a ransom in cryptocurrencies. Local press reported that the suspects wanted to be paid in Monero.
The unusual request underlined a growing trend for criminals to seek alternatives to bitcoin, which through its first decade has become the cryptocurrency of choice for illicit activities from buying contraband to laundering money, cyber security experts and law enforcement agencies say.
Monero’s use on darknet marketplaces - sites used for buying illicit goods from drugs to stolen credit cards - is on the rise, said Tom Robinson, chief data officer of Elliptic, a London-based firm that provides blockchain-tracking software to law enforcement agencies and private companies.
One of Monero’s developer team said Monero enables crime no more than cash. Its developers should stay out of debates on its traceability or risk undermining its decentralized nature, Francisco Cabanas told Reuters.
“It doesn’t selectively encourage crime, it encourages commerce,” said Cabanas, who goes by the nickname “ArcticMine,” in an interview via Skype from Vancouver. “In that respect, it’s no different to cash.”
Nevertheless, over 4 percent of the 17 million Monero in circulation were mined using malware, said Guillermo Suarez de Tangil, a cybersecurity lecturer at King’s College London who has researched Monero.
Monero’s developers say its characteristics make it a useful tool for companies looking to maintain commercial secrecy. Users in repressive countries looking to avoid censorship or surveillance can also safely move money in the form of Monero, they say.
Cryptocurrencies are mostly unregulated. Though countries from Britain to the United States are looking at how to deal with the phenomenon, few have set out comprehensive strategies for dealing with digital coins.
Asked about Monero, Borja Pastor de la Morena, an official at Europol in The Hague who oversees the agency’s work on money laundering said: “This kind of alternative cryptocurrency is more opaque and better at concealing the activity of the users.”
Britain’s finance ministry, which leads a task force that is looking at if and how Britain will regulate cryptocurrencies, said it was aware of the potential for Monero to be used for criminal ends.
“We recognize the risks with cryptoassets like ‘privacy coins’ being used for illicit activity,” a spokesperson said, adding that it would “soon” launch a consultation on bringing crypto-related companies under anti-money laundering regulation.
Mitchell Krawiec-Thayer, a San Francisco-based blockchain developer who is part of Monero Research Labs, said Monero is designed so it can be easily mined by individuals rather than powerful groups that team up to mine coins in industrial quantities.
“This lowers the barrier of entry to everyone,” he said. “The downside is that criminals have started using that. Stealing other people’s resources, putting strain on their equipment – it’s a straight-up threat.”
Daily transactions for Monero - one proxy for how widely the cryptocurrency is used - have hovered around 8,000 this month, data from website CoinMetrics shows. The number of active digital wallet addresses for Monero has hung around 5,000.----




https://magazine.fintechweekly.com/articles/an-untraceable-currency-bitcoin-privacy-concerns

*Bitcoin is often portrayed as an untraceable method of payment that facilitates illicit activities by enabling criminals to make and receive payments without being tracked. This depiction implies that users transacting in bitcoin can do so completely anonymously — that their identities will not be exposed. However, that is not necessarily the case. While bitcoin offers increased privacy compared to traditional payment methods involving a third-party intermediary such as a credit card provider, it is still not as anonymous as a cash transaction. In fact, there are many ways a person’s identity could potentially be exposed in bitcoin transactions.*
Bitcoin is not anonymous. As we explain below, it is pseudonymous — an important distinction. It is also a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, having no third-party intermediary (for instance, a credit card issuer, merchant processor or bank) that is involved to verify a transaction between a buyer and seller. Since there is no third party, there must be another way to verify a transaction between two users and avoid the “double-spending” problem (i.e., a way of ensuring that a user does not spend bitcoin they have previously transferred).
This is where the blockchain, the truly revolutionary aspect of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, comes into play. A blockchain is a public, distributed ledger, in which every transaction is recorded. Unlike traditional payment systems in which the ledger is maintained by a single third party, a blockchain ledger is distributed across a group of computers (thousands of them), each with its own copy of the blockchain transactions.
Each block of transactions in a blockchain is confirmed by users in the peer-to-peer network, called “miners,” who compete to solve a complex computational problem. The first successful miner to validate the transaction broadcasts it to the network, which then checks the results. Once checked, the new transactions are added as a new block to the blockchain. In the case of bitcoin, the miner who first successfully verified this transaction gets rewarded by the network with newly created bitcoins. As of July 2016, the reward was reduced from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins, and it is expected that the reward will be further reduced to 6.25 bitcoins in 2021.
Because the bitcoin blockchain is a permanent public record of all transactions accessible by anyone at any time, it is not anonymous. Instead, the transactions in the blockchain are encrypted with public key cryptography that masks the real identities of the individuals behind the transactions. This makes bitcoin pseudonymous. In each bitcoin transaction, each user is assigned two digital keys: (1) a public key or address — the address is actually a hash derived from the public key, but for purposes of this article, we use these terms interchangeably — which everyone can see and is published on the bitcoin blockchain, and (2) a private key, which is only known to the user and is the user’s “signature.”
The private key is used by others to verify that the transaction was in fact signed by that user. The bitcoin blockchain will only show that a transaction has taken place between two public keys (an identifier of 34 random alphanumeric characters), indicating the time and amount of the transaction.
Encryption might create the impression that these transactions are viewable but unmatchable to specific individuals. However, bitcoin is not as untraceable as encryption may imply. Tying an encrypted transaction to an actual individual is possible — it is not a remote risk. There are several ways this could occur.
Users who rely on a bitcoin trading exchange (such as Bitfinex, Binance or Kraken) to exchange currency for bitcoin have to divulge their personal information to that exchange to create an account. The information collected by the exchange varies, but normally includes, at a minimum, a user’s first and last name, and, possibly, a phone number. The exchange may also collect a user’s IP address. If these exchanges were subject to a data security breach, a user’s personal information could be exposed. In addition, some centralized exchanges offer to manage users’ bitcoin funds and users’ private keys on their behalf.
There are also online wallet service providers that manage users’ wallets on their behalf. A wallet is a software program that stores a collection of a user’s public and private key pairs. The storage of private keys makes these centralized exchanges, and online wallet service providers, prime targets for criminals because, as discussed above, anyone with access to a user’s private key will be able to create a valid bitcoin transaction. A hacker who accesses a user’s private key can send all of that user’s bitcoins to him or herself, or to any intermediary of their choosing.
There have been several high-profile breaches of exchanges in the past, including the February 2014 hack of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange. The Mt. Gox attack resulted in a loss of 850,000 bitcoins then valued at $450 million. Thus, hackers who gain control over a user’s exchange or online wallet account not only gain access to a user’s personal information and transaction history but also to a user’s bitcoin funds.
Exchanges are also increasingly subject to regulatory requirements that could lead to government entities accessing a user’s personal information. Bitcoin valuation plunged recently when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement warning that online platforms trading digital assets that meet the definition of “securities” would be considered exchanges under the securities laws and need to register with the SEC or show exemption from registration. Although the SEC has not taken any action to date, this means that cryptocurrency exchanges could be subject to the stringent securities regulations applicable to national securities exchanges.
Similarly, South Korea announced greater regulation of bitcoin earlier this year. Under the new South Korean regulation, users will only be able to deposit into their exchange wallets if the name used on the exchange matches the name on the user’s bank account. Exchanges are also already subject to certain legal requirements, such as responding to subpoenas, which could require them to share personal information with governmental authorities if required by law. For instance, the U.S.-based exchange Coinbase was recently ordered by a court to turn over to the Internal Revenue Service information regarding approximately 14,000 of its customers. A brief review of several exchanges’ online privacy policies indicates that exchanges will share a user’s information as needed to comply with their legal and regulatory obligations.
It is also possible to identify users simply by analyzing transactions on the blockchain. Companies like Elliptic and Chainanalysis have built businesses based on blockchain forensics. These companies use analytics on the bitcoin blockchain to link bitcoin addresses to web entities and help their customers assess the risk of illegal activities. Their customers include exchanges but also government entities. In fact, it became public last year that the IRS is using Chainanalysis’s software to track potential tax evaders.
Several studies have also shown that it is possible to use network analysis and other methods to observe and potentially tie back blockchain transactions to certain websites and individuals. Specifically, one 2013 study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego and George Mason University showed that it was possible to tag bitcoin addresses belonging to the same user by using clustering analysis of bitcoin addresses. A small number of private transactions with various services were used to identify major institutions (such as exchanges or large websites).
From there, the researchers were able to get information on the structure of the bitcoin network, where transaction funds are going and which organizations are party to it. Another study by researchers at ETH Zurich and NEC Laboratories Europe that looked at bitcoin transactions in a small university sample found that using behavior-based clustering techniques could unveil in a typical university environment the profiles of up to 40 percent of the users.
Despite these privacy issues, bitcoin users need not despair — there are ways to enhance one’s privacy on the bitcoin blockchain. First, a bitcoin user can use a new bitcoin address for each transaction and will thus receive a new public key for each transaction, making it more difficult to trace one specific individual’s transactions to the same address. This is actually the approach that was envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous (and still unknown) founder, who recommended in the paper that first introduced bitcoinusing “a new key pair … for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.”
Second, a bitcoin user can take some additional precautions to minimize the risk of traceability on third-party exchanges. The user could use the anonymous Tor browser to access the exchange and create an account without including any real personal information; the user’s IP address and personal information would not be exposed.
Third, the user could avoid storing bitcoins in online third-party wallets, and only use offline desktop wallets; that reduces the exposure to exchange hacks. Fourth, bitcoin mixing algorithms, such as CoinJoin, link users and allow them to pay together such that the bitcoins are mixed. This makes it harder to identify a particular user because only a group of transactions is published on the blockchain (although studies and research have shown that even CoinJoin presents weaknesses and could allow linking back to a particular individual).
These privacy issues have not gone unnoticed and alternative cryptocurrencies with an increased privacy focus have emerged. Monero is the most prominent of these alternatives. Unlike the bitcoin blockchain, which, as we have noted, is based on a two-key (public and private key) cryptography, the Monero blockchain is based on unique one-time keys and ring signatures. With ring signature technology, the actual signer is pooled together with a group of possible signers, forming a “ring.”
This creates a distinctive signature that can authorize a transaction. When an individual initiates a Monero transaction, the verifier is able to establish that a transaction came from a group but is not able to determine the identity of the initiator whose private key was used to produce the signature. As a result, the Monero blockchain does not identify a specific sender, and the receivers’ addresses and the transaction amounts are hidden. Monero has become the cryptocurrency of choice for privacy-focused users.
Although bitcoin is a decentralized and unregulated payment method, users should understand that this does not mean that their bitcoin transactions are anonymous and hidden from scrutiny. The public nature of the blockchain combined with the increasing threat of government regulation can lead to the identification of users engaged in transacting the currency.----

Standards are an invaluable worldwide resource. Globally there are well over half a million published standards. These are the products of over 1,000 recognised standards development organisations worldwide.
Standards Australia represents our nation on the two major international standardising bodies, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)* and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
We co-ordinate the attendance of Australian experts at international meetings and participate in the preparation of a wide range of International Standards. We are extremely active within the international standardisation movement and a number of our senior management team members hold important voluntary offices on international standards bodies.
International standards that are created through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) play a vital role in facilitating trade allowing Australian business to compete successfully in the global economy.
Standards Australia has a strong history of facilitating solutions that meet the needs of consumers and industry. It remains committed to enhancing the social, environmental and economic well being of all Australians by providing an active forum for discussion, debate and consensus.
The Standards Australia NEXTgen Program provides emerging leaders an exciting opportunity to become involved in the national and international standardisation processes which supports Australian industry and governments.
The program provides training and direct exposure to the standards development processes and technical committees. This involves having access to shared information and collective intelligence to develop standards that support the economy, improve safety and health, national resources and improve quality of life.
Through our work on key flagship activities, Standards Australia promotes the growth of new industries to support the development of a safe and secure environment, and create market confidence in new and established technical fields.
Standards Awards are presented to individuals, and one committee, who have made significant contributions to standardisation and who have demonstrated outstanding service in enabling Standards Australia and accredited Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) attain their objectives.
Blockchain, at the broadest level, is a digital platform that records and verifies transactions in a public and secure manner. It is a decentralised, cryptography based solution with the potential to redefine transactions and the back-office of a multitude of different industries.
In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a New Field of Technical Activity (NFTA) proposal on behalf of Australia for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology.
The proposal included the establishment of a new ISO technical committee responsible for blockchain standards topics including interoperability, terminology, privacy, security and auditing. This decision resulted in the creation of 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies ( ).
ISO/TC 307 meets twice a year. Work is progressing in many areas including reference architecture, terminology, smart contracts, governance, privacy, security and identity. Separate study groups were established to focus on use cases and interoperability, and additional research is underway on supply chain and trade facilitation, security evaluation of consensus models, and data flow.
Prior to the inaugural meeting of 307, Standards Australia established the mirror committee IT-041, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies ( ) , to provide an Australian voice to inform our vote at the ISO level.
In February 2017, Standards Australia hosted a Blockchain Standards Workshop with more than 50 participants representing government, industry, academic and consumer organisations and featured international and local speakers. This activity, complemented by data from a survey, culminated in the production of a *Roadmap for Blockchain Standards* ( ) , identifying priority areas for standardisation in blockchain. This formed a forward work-plan for IT-041, and greatly contributed to Australia’s leadership on international blockchain standards.
Standards Australia continues to engage proactively to promote Australia’s leading role in the development of international blockchain standards, and to provide opportunities to share technical information.

A blockchain is a collaborative, tamper-resistant ledger that maintains transactional records. The transactional records (data) are grouped into blocks. A block is connected to the previous one by including a unique identifier that is based on the previous block’s data. As a result, if the data is changed in one block, it’s unique identifier changes, which can be seen in every subsequent block (providing tamper evidence). This domino effect allows all users within the blockchain to know if a previous block’s data has been tampered with. Since a blockchain network is difficult to alter or destroy, it provides a resilient method of collaborative record keeping.
NIST researchers have been investigating blockchain technologies at multiple levels: from use cases, applications and existing services, to protocols, security guarantees, and cryptographic mechanisms. Research outcomes include scientific papers and the production of software for experimentation as well as providing direction for other NIST endeavors in this space. Blockchain has the potential to be implemented in many different systems, to include manufacturing supply chains, data registries, digital identification, and records management.
Summary: The BIA COI – with members from government, industry, and academia – is providing guidelines to create a (better) synergy between end users, research community, and solution providers to reduce complexity, cost, and delay of adoption of blockchain technologies.
Summary: The Enhanced Distributed Ledger Technology project examines the traditional blockchain data structure and seeks to create a new data structure (the block matrix) to provide high reliability, and security while also enabling deletion or updating capabilities not currently found in most blockchain systems.

The industry's flagship annual conference ( ) was held this week in New York City, and there were 1500 attendees and 150 speakers. Eight years after this technology was first described in a nine-page paper ( ) dropped on the internet by a mysterious computer scientist, interest is suddenly exploding among blue chip financial firms, who are exploring how Bitcoin and blockchains can make their operations more efficient.
Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, pitched a new initiative ( ) to draw companies in this space to relocate to his state; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers touted the blockchain's disruptive potential; and Microsoft, the once lumbering tech giant, was out in force, embracing blockchain technology with the hope of finally getting a jump on its competitors.
The mainstream interest on display was a little surreal for Erik Voorhees, a libertarian who got involved with Bitcoin in 2011, launched the gambling platform SatoshiDice ( ) the following year, and now heads ShapeShift ( ) , a cryptocurrency exchange.
"If you look at the industry today, are most of them libertarians, I don't know," said Voorhees. "Mostly it's just business people, but that's fine. Business people will grow the system and to me it doesn't matter because the freedom that the asset brings to people happens on the back of the technology."
But the buzzword at this year's conference was blockchain, not bitcoin, a distinction that's indicative of mainstream misgivings about working with a system that's open for anyone to use. Many banks are partnering with companies building so-called private blockchains that mimic some aspects of Bitcoin's architecture except they're designed to be closed off and accessible only to chosen parties.
"The big companies want to improve themselves [but] they don't want to disrupt themselves," said William Mougayar, an investor and author of a new business guide ( ) to the blockchain industry that draws analogies to the early days of the internet, when open access drove rapid innovation.
On Monday morning, just as the conference was getting underway in New York, the industry was abuzz. Craig Wright, a 45-year-old Australian computer scientist, had just publicly declared that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the man who created Bitcoin under that pseudonym eight years ago. The claim was given credence by Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, who flew to London last month to meet Wright and vet his story.
Meanwhile, other prominent figures in the community disputed the evidence and labeled Wright a likely imposter, including Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the popular blockchain platform Ethereum. By day two of the conference, Wright wrote on his blog that he would provide "extraordinary proof" to support his claim, and then two days later he took it back ( ) , saying that he didn't have the courage.
So why does this question bring up such strong feelings within the industry? "If you have a hero who's kind of mythical that everyone can project whatever they want onto him," says Buterin. "Whereas if it turns into a real living, breathing figure…you can criticize his tax history, and his sex life, and it's a totally different story."
Satoshi's mysterious identity helped Bitcoin attract such an ideologically diverse following by allowing its devotees to attach their own meanings to this hard-to-define technology. But most people, including Buterin, agree that today it's taken on a life of its own. "The incentives built into the system are really beautiful," says Gavin Andresen. "And so a lot of people have an incentive to make it work."
"It's gratifying to see events like this," says Andresen, who played a key role in building support for Bitcoin in its early days. "It shows that if you have a great technology and you make it open and available to the world, the world will eventually notice. It might take a few years. But people will notice."----

The recent hack of the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) ( ) , a cryptocurrency experiment built on the Ethereum blockchain network that raised more than $US150 million worth of cryptocurrency ( ) , served as further proof for the bank that public blockchains were still too risky for adoption, and would likely remain so for the forseeable future.
"The point about who controls a public blockchain is slightly worrying and what happened with Ethereum two weeks ago is a great test case," ANZ group strategy executive manager Nicholas Groves said at the Blockchain Summit on Wednesday.
Blockchain technology allows a list of transactions to be shared among a number of computers, rather than on a central server, and the secure ledger updates in almost real-time across all the systems in the network.
Blockchain networks can be either public or private. Public blockchains have many users and there are no controls over who can read, upload or delete the data and there are an unknown number of pseudonymous participants.
"For a lot of what banks need to do, private blockchains are the most sensible and realistic option, and more than that it's actually technology that's been around for quite a long time," Mr Groves said referring to the work of Leslie Lamport, a founding father of distributed computing in the late '70s and '80s.
"If we can work out the bits we really need, we can progress toward operational solutions in reasonably short time frames, because we're avoiding a lot of the new, complex and very hairy issues with [public blockchains]."
ANZ is the the only major Australian bank not to have joined R3 group, a consortium of 42 banks globally which is an innovation firm focused on researching how blockchain can be used in financial services.
In May The Australian Financial Review revealed that the consortium was planning a $ US200 million capital raising, which would be used to fund the consortiums Distributed Ledger Group ( ) , which would be spun out of R3.
Audience members at the Blockchain Summit pushed Mr Groves about whether or not ANZ could ever envisage a situation where the public blockchain would be the most suitable type of network for the bank, but he said not in the next decade.
"If the world ever got to the point of saying I'm comfortable of securing my own private keys... then you'd see a rapid rise. It's a scenario that could happen... am I worried it will takeover and wipe out the banks in the next 5-10 years? No."

Well, the blockchain ( ) of 6,000 years ago — cuneiform. It was, as scholars have shown ( ) , a newfangled transaction recording system that applied innovative cryptography ( ) to existing technology. Replace the wedge-shaped codes on clay tablets ( ) with algorithmically encrypted data on a computer network ( ) , and baby, you’ve got a stew going. Cuneiform, like blockchain, was invented out of the desire to create a secure, transparent exchange. Nobody likes to get screwed, be it in sheep or Dogecoin ( ).
Blockchain is most famously associated with Bitcoin ( ) and Ethereum ( ) , which use the technology to create secure currencies with real-world value backed by the time and energy spent encrypting them. It’s easier to clone a sheep than to counterfeit a cryptocurrency. The growing ubiquity of multi-million dollar NFTs ( non-fungible tokens ( ) ) and cryptocurrencies has pushed blockchain into the mainstream. And, unless you’ve been stuck in a Sumerian stockyard, you know that mainstream in the 21st century means gaming.
Dr. Serkan Toto ( ) , CEO and Founder of Tokyo-based Kantan Games Inc., an independent game industry consultancy, tells Inverse, “A lot of these games seem to be forced exercises in basically trying to use blockchain and digital ownership and monetization.”
If the idea of a “forced exercise” doesn’t sound like fun to you, you’d be right. The current state of blockchain gaming is largely focused on creating assets for valuable transactions, not on hauling home accolades from The Game Awards ( ). If the notion seems a bit dystopian to you, remember, one gamer’s spreadsheet is another’s EVE Online ( ). Blockchain gaming has already found an audience of enthusiastic participants, but its future rests on finding a much larger one.
“There's no real fun inside many of these games,” says Toto. “Making them fun is the hard part. Making them secure for children, making them safe for everybody to use — that's easier to solve than making these games fun and engaging.”
After testing out a couple of the space’s best-known titles, Inverse spoke with a games industry analyst and a founder of a blockchain gaming studio to find out what blockchain could mean for the future of interactive entertainment.
Blockchain video games are any video game that uses some aspect of cryptographic blockchain technology. As a genre, this typically means the video games are comprised of loosely skinned software designed to get players into the cryptocurrency market.
The items you acquire in blockchain video games — weapons, skins, experience points — have a tangible value that players can trade with other players. Imagine selling your XP to a new player of a game you finished long ago, or offloading your excess inventory in Skyrim for real-world money. Blockchain gaming makes this possible.
Digital ownership exists in games now, but not with any of the value or stakes blockchain allows. You can “own” all the Fortnite skins you want, but you can’t sell them (legitimately and openly) to other players.
Publishers already have their hands full deterring hackers and cheaters from breaking their games to gain an advantage in online play. Current technology isn’t secure enough to keep a motivated cheater from juicing a spread, let alone host a marketplace with millions of dollars in public transactions.
Blockchain technology makes these markets possible by keeping individual player assets secure. Michael Sanders, Chief Storyteller and Co-Founder at Horizon Blockchain Games, tells Inverse that this innovation can benefit players and publishers alike.
“The biggest shift will be creating economies that are symbiotic. So players can share in the value that's created by the game, instead of just the game creator,” Sanders explains. “Thoughtful economy design will serve players and allow for sustainability for us as a company. We're going to see so many innovative games where the game and its economy are interwoven.”
The best-known blockchain game is CryptoKitties, developed by Dapper Labs and released in 2017. Players use Ethereum to purchase NFTs of cute cartoon cats with distinct traits that can be bred to produce unique offspring. The rarity of the traits determines their value. So how much could an NFT of a cartoon cat possibly be worth?
And that’s just the highest-selling one. Estimates suggest the CryptoKitties economy is worth as much as $10 million in transactions annually. The term “economy” is applicable here because CryptoKitties users take home about 80 percent of that, with Dapper Labs getting a small cut in transaction and “breeding” fees.
In a traditional video game, like the Pokémon series, breeding is an in-game mechanic that requires certain conditions be met. In CryptoKitties , it's a blockchain transaction that generates a new NFT. The lack of traditional mechanics doesn’t end there. CryptoKitties don’t do anything. They’re just nice to look at. If you’re expecting a high-stakes version of Neko Atsume ( ) , think again.
Another massive blockchain game is The Sandbox. Developed by Pixowl, it’s a more traditional game in the vein of Minecraft or Roblox that pivoted to blockchain when it was acquired by Animoca Brands in 2018.
The Sandbox ’s blockchain tech is used for the creation of its unique cryptocurrency called SAND. Players get access to a toolkit that allows them to build pretty much anything, and those assets are sold on a marketplace. It also features a limited amount of real estate on its in-game map, called LAND, leading to big-ticket purchases from the likes of Atari ( ) and the Winkelvoss Twins ( ). How much is all this worth?
To begin to “play,” one must first set up a Coinbase account and buy Ethereum. Then you need to download the Coinbase wallet app, which is different from the Coinbase account app. Then you link CryptoKitties to your wallet and, after a brief tutorial about breeding cats for crypto, you browse. The cheapest cats I could find were about $15 each, plus there’s a breeding fee. So you’re looking at around $30-50 upfront to get two cats and get started.
If you can get started, that is. I kept receiving an error message about problems processing a transaction fee, along with a warning that fees were higher than usual because of “blockchain congestion.” Then the dapp (or “decentralized app”) simply stopped loading. I couldn’t even access the game after multiple failed attempts, about an hour of setting up crypto stuff, and transferring $50 worth of Ethereum into my Coinbase wallet.
The Sandbox fared better. I wasn’t able to access the full game (it’s still in development) but it lets players download the creation software and tinker to their heart’s content. No upfront purchase required and registration was easy. Still, creating voxel assets with Unity-based visual scripting tools is about as dry as it sounds.
“There are two different skill sets. Building blockchain architecture and a blockchain application is different than what's required of game development,” says Sanders. “It’s a challenge to marry these two skill sets and have the vision to create something that a regular gamer — and not just a crypto-interested gamer — would enjoy playing.”
Sanders and the team at Horizon are optimistic about their own blockchain game, Skyweaver. It’s a CCG, or collectible card game, in the vein of Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering. The blockchain element for Skyweaver is that the cards are NFTs ( ) , and players have full ownership. Horizon can’t even access players' cards once they get a deck. The more you play, the more rare cards you earn, and you can sell those cards to other players.
Sanders and the rest of the team at Horizon feel that successful blockchain gaming puts the gaming first. A well-designed game will attract an enthusiastic fan base, and the best blockchain tech in the world amounts to an empty wallet without active and engaged buyers and sellers.
“First and foremost, you have to get rid of the friction so that the gamer can just get into the game itself,” he says. “The blockchain tech is not that meaningful unless the game itself is enjoyable in the first place.”
There are two obstacles in the way of blockchain gaming’s future: investor risk and PR. Investors want stability, predictability, and growth. Blockchain gaming doesn’t offer that yet, because to transfer value to players you inherently remove value from the companies.
“Don't underestimate how conservative gaming studios are, especially monetization-wise,” Toto says, referencing the appeal of monetization methods like loot boxes and microtransactions to publishers. “When you have a golden goose in your portfolio, it will take some time for game companies to adopt this concept of monetization and introducing users to the idea of digital ownership.”
There’s also a backlash against crypto and NFTs because of the carbon footprint associated with their creation. Recently, a site that tracked the footprint for NFTs was shut down because it was being used to harass artists ( ). Sega of Japan’s announcement ( ) of plans to start selling NFT digital content this summer sparked outrage among fans who said it was a betrayal of the environmentalist values ( ) instilled in them by the company’s flagship mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog.
“Physical collectibles require a whole supply chain, they require manufacturing and plastic and shipping and gasoline,” he said. “The physical good creates way more of a carbon footprint. That NFT, by comparison, is virtually non-existent.”
Still, blockchain companies are aware that sustainability is a major hurdle to mainstream acceptance and are developing solutions. The most promising is a shift away from what’s called “proof of work” to something called “proof of stake.”
Proof of work refers to the value of an NFT because of the “work” spent encrypting it, i.e., the environmental cost of all that computational time. Instead, major players like Ethereum are considering proof of stake, which requires users in the blockchain to keep a stake in the market to ensure good-faith transactions. It’s complicated ( ) , but if it works, the environmental cost of blockchain transactions could reduce to zero.
Sanders is more optimistic. He thinks blockchain gaming will have a bright future once gamers recognize the opportunity it offers them, and once companies understand the value those gamers will bring to this new type of economy.
“Gamers will get to participate in the value created by these networks while having fun. And they essentially have a stake in the games they're playing. It becomes a symbiotic relationship between game creators and players,” he says. “I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it's gonna look like, this notion of the metaverse and being able to enter this internet of value. But this is kind of a fun entry point.”----




https://www.investopedia.com/tech/three-people-who-were-supposedly-bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto/

Erika Rasure, is the Founder of Crypto Goddess, the first learning community curated for women to learn how to invest their money—and themselves—in crypto, blockchain, and the future of finance and digital assets. She is a financial therapist and is globally-recognized as a leading personal finance and cryptocurrency subject matter expert and educator.
One of the most enduring mysteries of bitcoin ( ) is the identity of its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto ( ). Little is known about him. His last communication was in April 2011, two years after the network came into existence.
Nakamoto is important to the bitcoin ecosystem beyond his status as a founder. He is a philosophical figurehead of sorts and frequently invoked among cryptocurrency ( ) proponents debating the future of bitcoin's development. For example, both sides in the contentious forking of Bitcoin Cash ( ) (itself a fork of the original bitcoin blockchain ( ) ) claimed to uphold Nakamoto’s original vision for the currency. Bitcoin wallets ( ) associated with Nakamoto hold 980,000 bitcoin (about $6.2 billion as of March 2020). Given that just 21 million Bitcoin will ever be mined, Nakamoto’s holdings have the potential to significantly affect its price, if and when they are traded.
Despite numerous efforts to uncover his identity, Nakamoto has proven elusive. Several individuals have been proposed but none have been proven to be Satoshi Nakamoto beyond a doubt. Here are three candidates.
This perhaps was the most high-profile attempt to reveal bitcoin’s founder. Newsweek in March 2014 identified Dorian Nakamoto as the currency's creator. Publication of the article caused a hullabaloo in the crypto and wider tech community, as this was the first time a mainstream publication had attempted to learn the identity of bitcoin’s creator.
Newsweek claimed several similarities between Satoshi Nakamoto and Dorian Nakamoto. For example, both supposedly held libertarian leanings and a Japanese connection. (Dorian, who graduated in physics from California Polytechnic and worked on classified defense projects, is Japanese-American). The article’s author also claimed Nakamoto said he was “no longer” involved with bitcoin and that he had “turned it over” to other people. ﻿ ﻿
The magazine’s biggest mistake was to publish a photograph of Nakamoto’s home. A cursory image search could easily reveal its location. While many did not believe Dorian Nakamoto was bitcoin’s founder, the crypto community was aghast his privacy had been violated.
Still, the media circus was not without profit for Dorian Nakamoto. An online campaign raised more than 100 bitcoins on his behalf. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ The fund was the bitcoin community’s way of saying “thanks.” In April 2014, Dorian Nakamoto appeared in a YouTube video along with fundraiser Andreas Antonopoulos to thank the bitcoin community for their support. ﻿ ﻿
In December 2015, Wired Magazine wrote a profile on Wright, claiming it had "obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity.” The article reported on Wright's appearance via Skype at that year's Bitcoin Investor’s Conference in Las Vegas. When asked about his credentials, Wright claimed he was “a bit of everything.” He listed his degrees, including a master’s in statistics and two doctorates. He also said: "I've been involved with all of this for a long time ... I try and keep my head down."
Wired 's evidence consisted of references to a "cryptocurrency paper" on Wright's blog that appeared months before the bitcoin whitepaper began to circulate. In addition, there were leaked emails and correspondence with Wright’s lawyer that referenced a “P2P distributed ledger." Furthermore, leaked transcripts of meetings with attorneys and tax officials quoted him as saying: “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running bitcoin since 2009. By the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know.”
Those claims were soon thrown into doubt. Wired followed up its report to note several inconsistencies in Wright's story. For example, the blog entries appeared to be backdated. Evidence also suggested that public encryption keys linked to Satoshi Nakamoto were also backdated. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who is otherwise reticent about politics in the cryptocurrency world, came out against Wright, publicly calling him a fraud.
But Wright remains unfazed by the criticism and has parlayed the media attention to carve out a prominent role within the crypto community. He led a contentious fork of Bitcoin Cash, forming Bitcoin SV. He is also chief science officer at nChain, a blockchain solutions business that serves enterprise customers. As of 2021, Wright is embroiled in a series of legal entanglements that may eventually prove or disprove his claims, should evidence be presented in court.
Nick Szabo is a computer engineer and legal scholar. He is credited with pioneering the concept of smart contracts ( ) in a 1996 paper. In 2008, he conceptualized a decentralized currency he called Bit Gold ( ) , a precursor to bitcoin. He described Bit Gold as “a protocol whereby unforgeable costly bits could be created online with minimal dependence on trusted third parties.” This is similar to the bitcoin concept, whereby a series of bits created by a network of computers without a leader verify and validate transactions.
Author Dominic Frisby makes the case that Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto in his book, Bitcoin: The Future of Money? Frisby consulted a stylometrics expert who concluded that Szabo’s writing style was similar to known writings from Satoshi. Another clue is that both Szabo and Satoshi reference economist Carl Menger. In addition, Frisby learned Szabo had worked for DigiCash, an early attempt to bring cryptography to digital payments. In the author's eyes, this strongly suggested Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto.

http://tpbit.blogspot.com/2015/06/bitcoin-vs-blockchain.html

If we're talking in a literal sense, that statement is obviously false - there is nothing in Bitcoin that imbues its blockchain with some special properties unobtainable by say, Litecoin or Dogecoin. However, if we're talking in a more broad sense about blockchains without native coins that provide an incentive for the miners ( ) to be creating more blocks, things get a bit more complicated.
In a traditional blockchain like Bitcoin, the native currency is not only used to incentivise the miners, but also to prevent spam. It is quite an elegant solution - anyone wishing to send a payment won't mind spending less than a penny to get their transaction included in a block, but someone flooding the network with spam transactions will feel the burden of the fees compounding on them.
A blockchain without an internal currency loses both the incentive for the miners to create new blocks and prevent spam through the use of fees. While this would probably cripple any decentralized blockchain, it might not be the case with more centralized blockchains (we'll discuss them in detail later on).
The miners can be subsidized in other fashion, or even ran for free by the businesses that rely on the network. This is the case with Ripple's validators ( ) - most of them are run by Ripple Labs, since they have a strong stake to keep the network running, but one could imagine a more decentralized network with validators being run by the various gateways on the network. Since the validators earn money in some other way (running gateways, providing other services, etc.), it makes sense to keep the servers running.
If we're talking about blockchains without fees, Hyperledger ( ) and Eris ( ) come to mind. While those solutions don't appear to be suitable for decentralized networks, they make sense if we're talking about a finite number of known servers communicating with one another. In this scenario, similar to a private network, you don't expect spam or DOS attacks to be an issue - all the parties are known and they have no motivation to attack the network. Moreover, if the users of the network are known, they can be punished if they try to break the network - either by having their access revoked, or possibly by some legal actions being taken against them.
There are many reasons to connect to a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin - you can transact with anyone in the world, nobody can ban you from the network and all your transactions are forever stored and distributed among many computers all around the world. However, there are also some needs that can't be achieved in a public ledger - protection of private data, instant transaction speed, dealing with only known parties, etc. All of those are features needed by some companies - perhaps they need to follow strict KYC rules on all clients, or they are dealing with sensitive financial information that need to be kept private. One way or the other - there are some valid reasons to run a private blockchain.
There are certainly many disadvantages - since the blockchain is a new technology, it might not be as optimized as a database. If we're talking about a distributed network, there is also a lot of delay when the data is transmitted, not to mention the block creation time itself.
While there might be little use for a blockchain technology if it's used by a single entity, it certainly bring up a lot of benefits if we're considering multiple parties using the blockchain technology to conduct business:
* All transactions on the network can be legally binding as per agreement (especially if we're talking about making business decisions using smart contracts or tracking debt using a Ripple-like ledger)
* Given the block creators are trusted entities (in a model similar to BitShares ( ) or Eris ( ) ), or everyone using the network is also a block creator (in an ideal consensus mechanism ( ) ), there is a strong disincentive to attack the network through a 51%-esque attack (block creators can be legally liable for doing such a thing)
First of all, anything that happens on a large, decentralized blockchain such as Bitcoin can be verified to have happened at the given time. Centralized blockchains can be re-written or forged if all the involved parties collude, while a decentralized blockchain is much harder to corrupt. This is why we see companies like Factom ( ) using the Bitcoin blockchain for timestamping - the record is public and provably immutable. Any private blockchain wishing to prove their records were not altered would similarly have to use the Bitcoin blockchain and embed the block hashes into it to prove the data was not altered later down the line.
Secondly, it may be much easier for multiple companies to agree to use a decentralized network as a middleware ( ) , rather than them agreeing to use a proprietary blockchain. This is especially true if we would be talking about companies dealing with entities they don't know or don't trust. Using a decentralized network allows you to tap into its network effect - you're not only connected to a few parties, but to potentially everyone in the world.
All in all, there are advantages and disadvantages to both using centralized and decentralized blockchains. Every one of them is a tool of its own, and some might be more suitable for problems than others. While the Bitcoin network certainly has a lot of value on its own, it's not a silver bullet solution to all problems and use cases. Blockchain without Bitcoin is certainly possible, but even in the world filled with centralized blockchains, Bitcoin has a place of its own.----




http://www.dugcampbell.com/bitcoin-v-the-blockchain/

Over recent months, we’ve seen a number of recurring themes in the Bitcoin community. Whilst the heated block size debate ( ) appears high up on that list, I wanted to touch on another key narrative that’s continuing to provoke much discussion.
I’ve had a number of conversations recently within traditional financial services organisations who are starting to explore the potential of blockchain technology. But one thing is clear. Whilst the technology is becoming increasingly attractive to them, Bitcoin itself is still sometimes seen as a weird crypto-anarchic-libertarian concept that must first be set aside in order to let the real work commence.
But innovation should be welcomed in whatever form it takes – whether incremental or ‘Big Bang’ disruptive. Whilst the second option is clearly more attractive, I’d argue smaller steps are still worth taking when the true enemy is actually the status quo. The value of innovation is often subjective in any event, viewed differently according to each person’s unique mix of perspective and timescale.
So, to draw a parallel from my past life, a law firm that develops automated document assembly plans for the future will be dismissed without a second thought by those who are seeking to develop smart contracts that automate those firms themselves out of existence and vice versa. But then the technologists fail to develop an understanding of the all-too-real existing constraints and the incumbents fail to set their sights high enough.
The lesson? If opposing sides simply dismiss competing arguments without taking the time to genuinely explore their merits, both risk missing out on the subtleties. So with this post, I intend to do just that. Not to provide answers per se but to collect some key arguments from both side of the debate. Of course, it’s merely scraping the surface. But it’s worth starting with an overview.
Many who repeat the “blockchain good, bitcoin bad” refrain have overlooked one key fact. Many businesses that the press are now championing as being pioneers of blockchain technology are actually reliant on Bitcoin.
Whether that’s NASDAQ’s decision to use ‘a blockchain ledger’ on its Private Market platform ( ) , the use of ‘distributed ledgers’ to streamline financial settlement ( ) by Digital Assets Holdings ( ) (check out this recent talk by the CEO, ex-JP Morgan senior exec Blythe Masters ( ) ) or even Overstock’s CryptoBond ( ) , any mention of Bitcoin itself is often abstracted by the press in favour of a focus on blockchain technology.
So it’s important to remember that each of these not-insubstantial bets have been made by people and organisations who believe that Bitcoin’s blockchain will succeed (check out the diplomatically-worded blog post by Peter at CoinCenter ( ) for a similar perspective).
Secure. Public. Permanent. Immutable. Massively resilient. Just a few of the features that describe the Satoshi Blockchain. Yet all of these features cannot exist without one thing: Bitcoin miners who believe that they will earn more money than they spend if they turn on their computers to take part.
Incentive is crucial to the Satoshi Blockchain. If it will cost a miner £151 to get one Bitcoin by turning on his computer to mine when he could simply buy one for £150, which option do you think he will choose?
Unless the value of bitcoins to be won by miners exceeds the money they spend in burning electricity and investing in the capital infrastructure necessary to compete for dominance in the current mining arms race, the Satoshi Blockchain would be far less secure – and all of those fascinating projects listed above would be going nowhere.
The mining game might be preparing to undergo significant change with the resolution of the current block size impasse, just as 21 ( ) turns on its mining capacity ( ) (and BitFury their lightbulbs ( ) !). But irrespective, under the current model, it’s clear that the miners need to be paid for the system to work.
In other words, if you build a permissionless system (that is open to anyone to join) that requires money, it must use a native currency. You cannot use money that is issued by a third party because there is always a risk that that third party might then censor (e.g. delay or withhold) payments. Instead, the money must be created within the system itself and it must function as a bearer instrument itself (like cash) – in other words, if you hold it, it’s yours (with no third party rights cutting across the ownership).
And this is why it is impossible to separate Bitcoin from the Satoshi Blockchain. There is simply no other way to incentivise the miners. It needs native digital money that is valuable and a guarantee that this will only be distributed according to the rules of the protocol.
But – hold on a second. Proof of Work (a security model that intentionally makes it very expensive to attack the network because it requires miners to burn all this electricity) is surely only necessary under certain conditions.
What if you’re a financial organisation? You don’t actually want the system to be open to everyone. You want to restrict those who have the ability to update the ledger to an agreed number of known people – because if it all goes wrong, you’ve then got someone to sue. You’re perfectly happy with the security systems that you currently use within your organisation to date and provided you control the small number of people who can update the ledger, you don’t need Proof of Work to protect the integrity of the network.
And I believe that it’s here that you see the key point emerge. Bitcoin’s model works amazingly well because it is a close-to-perfect solution for people for whom the anonymous verification of transactions carried out on a P2P basis (meaning that no third party is required) is one of the key attractions.
But within financial services, a heavily-regulated sector that views anonymity as a weakness and collectively has no desire to avoid censorship by third parties, a demand for a related type of blockchain-technology with a different feature-set appears to have emerged.
Here, there’s no need for miners. Save the money and replace them with ‘permissioned’ blockchains. This simply means that those using this private blockchain can ensure that someone who wishes to update the ledger must be authorised in advance and their identity known. Suddenly we have a very different beast. Now we have a database tool that no longer needs tokens that command a market value – because they have no need to act as an incentive. And of course, it avoids any uncomfortable questions about bitcoins within an environment that demands a high level of compliance and box-ticking.
For many, this closing of the doors and restricting access goes against the very essence of the (Satoshi) Blockchain. But there seems to be a growing understanding that as the area continues to be explored, people are most likely talking about (at least) two very different concepts. There’s an argument that the term ‘blockchain’ cannot cover both concepts.
In some ways, yes. But this is a database on steroids. One that contains rules about who can update the ledger and how. One that gives you conclusive evidence of when the records were changed and by whom. One that can be designed to reject any types of transactions that are deemed to be unacceptable at the outset. And one that will be reconciled globally in a fraction of the time that it currently takes and therefore can be automatically audited.
When it comes to the banking industry, it’s hard to believe that back office settlement platforms won’t move soon to decentralised ledgers. Think about the current system for a minute. Currently every bank has to spend huge amounts of time recording and continually reconciling complete records of every single transaction that takes place between them. If A sends money to B, both A and B have to record that transaction in their respective books. One transaction, two records. But what if that transaction was instead recorded automatically on one single ledger?
However, as Richard Gendall Brown explains in writing about this concept that he has called the replicated, shared ledger ( ) , these should not now be an issue. The system works because there is a single record of all transactions, a copy of which (complete, updated and protected) is held by each financial institution. Each would only be allowed to update the records that relate directly to its own dealings – and so the master record is now collectively maintained by all, allowing everyone to enjoy the benefits of a system with vastly improved efficiency.
To me, it’s clear there is a use-case for both types – and no doubt many variations in between (and beyond). Undoubtedly permissioned block chains are a significant step forwards for the financial services industry (amongst others). However, as progressive as such a change would be, it still doesn’t provide the oxygen that is so readily available within a permissionless system such as Bitcoin to nurture the truly ground-breaking innovations.
With the evidence to date, the answer to me seems to come down to this. Large financial services will inevitably focus on incremental change – because when you’re dealing with such significant sums of money and the strictures of regulation, any improvements in efficiency, no matter how small, will have massive financial benefits. Permissioned systems will therefore fill this role successfully in the shorter term.
Yet the true innovation, the moon shots and the long-term disruption must, in my view still be discovered within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s almost certain that the business models that will truly disrupt the existing financial sector have not yet been found. But I do believe they’re coming. So if you’re in a bank and you think that there’s even a 1% chance of Bitcoin being successful, you surely need to be thinking extremely carefully about the future and position yourself accordingly because the effects of waking up and seeingt such a day arrive are so significant.----

This is the central question of Bitcoin’s skeptics. Bitcoin doesn’t scale, they say. But the scaling question is stupid. You don’t understand what’s going on here if you think it matters. Let me explain why.
Bitcoin is highly versatile. Bitcoin’s network, itself, doesn’t need to scale to a trillion billion transactions per second. As Bitcoin grows, as it institutionalizes, there is a clear reality that Bitcoiners are going to have to accept. It’s a settlement engine. I didn’t coin the phrase. I believe that Greg Maxwell called Bitcoin a settlement engine in the Bitcoin core mailing list. But that’s what it is. To the chagrin of Bitcoin Cash users, this is what a blockchain has to be. Blockchains don’t, themselves, scale. They never will. They don’t need to.
What has happened, what will continue to happen, and what I have always said is that Bitcoin will bring in institutions. This is where the stupidity of Bitcoin’s most ardent anarchic asshats get off the train. The Antonopoulos’s of the world didn’t see this very obvious reality. And the fact that they didn’t is a blindness that probably is responsible for the Blockchain warring we are all familiar with. Institutions aren’t evil qua evil. They are simply amoral. And they come with a hell of a lot of experience.
So to the question, how do you get Bitcoin to do as many transactions on VISA and Mastercard… the answer is, you put them on VISA and Mastercard. A centralized rail will allow Bitcoins to move at the speed of light within the same database that VISA and Mastercard manage their own financial transactions. This comes at the cost of privacy. But most people aren’t looking for encrypted privacy in all transactions. Buying a sandwich or a coffee doesn’t need it. How do you get institutions to begin accepting stable coins? You create a clearinghouse for that money. You net each day, and you hit a single central database. You don’t need lightning to scale. You need institutions. Lightning is a great fallback. But it isn’t necessarily the answer. At least not in the immediate moment. The answer, at this time, is institutions. Institutions scale Bitcoin. And institutions carry with them the most important part of scaling a financial network: liability. If they lose your money, you can sue them. You can get your money back from them in the courts.
So do you get it now? The world of decentralized finance is dependent on institutions. And the bigger Bitcoin gets, the more centralized institutions become dependent on it. Bitcoin will not recreate finance. Rather, traditional finance will recreate the way that we use it by wrapping their millennia of experience in clearing, settlement, and more onto the industry. And that’s a good thing Bitcoiners. Embrace it. If you don’t like it, then keep your bitcoins out of the institutions. But for the everyman, for the ma and pa users, that’s the only way to get them. Don’t begrudge them their technophobia. Don’t foist your ideology of decentralization on to them. Just sit back and enjoy the adoption.
Remember when Krugman proposed printing a single coin worth some trillion dollars and pegging US Bonds against it? When he proposed it, I thought it was an insanely stupid idea. But now I have an insanely stupid idea, and I’d love to hear why it’s stupid.
As the Corona Virus rages all throughout the world, countries have seen some $15 trillion dollars wiped off the balance sheets. Companies have plummeted, and countries have begun printing money in order to stave off the possible problems. In the US, there are proposals on the table to literally send Americans thousands of dollars to get through these hard times.
Here’s the problem, the world has no way of dealing with international externalities. China refuses to deal with its wet markets. For now, put your conspiracies about the origins of Corona aside. Let’s presume it was of a natural origin and not created in a lab. On your own time, you can presume anything you want about it. But for now, let’s stick with the official narrative. Recognize that this is virus is one of many that we regularly deal with that originates in China. The country as a whole refuses to deal with the ways they raise animals and the proximity of humans to these wild beasts. We know that many of these animals harbor viruses that are readying themselves for transmission to humans. These animals include bats, pangolins, baby mice, dogs, monkeys, pigs, and more.
In the right conditions, most of these problems can be averted. But when humans are eating things like raw bats or Pangolins or baby mice, or putting monkeys in cages while they are alive, cutting open their heads, and munching on their brains, perhaps it is time to begin pointing fingers. When these viruses jump from animal to human and develop the ability to move from human to human, the result can be a pandemic. China has gifted us MERS, SARS, and now COVID-19. All of these in successive, short order. Not to mention, the annual flu’s dubious origins. China! China! China!
Perhaps it’s time we charge China. In the way that Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall. In this case, however, China has a lot of American debt. They are holders of $1.1 trillion in US debt. These treasuries, I believe, are serialized We know which ones we issued to them.
Why not create a new kind of debt instrument? We call it the Wuhan Bond, perhaps. It acts as a sort of series B US dollar. These bonds are bills to other nations. We issue them based on externalities. China makes America spend $5 trillion to stave off the dire effects of a crisis? The American people have mounting medical bills? No problem. We print $5 trillion in Wuhan bonds and put them to the China account. Any treasury China has purchased will be paid in these bonds. Any debt that we owe China will be paid in these bonds. Any trade deal we strike with China will use these bonds as negotiable instruments. You want a great deal? Excellent. Let’s talk about how to pay off the remaining $3.9 trillion you owe us. What kind of tariffs will you agree to?
Maybe this ruins the Chinese economy. Perhaps it takes off and the whole world begins issuing these externality bonds. But as far as I see it, there are times to employ this sort of thing judiciously. China owes America and her people every dollar they spend getting themselves healthy. China owes money to every family that lost a loved one. You might even say they owe us all of their tea. And it’s not just us. It’s Italy, France, Iran, for God’s sake.
But this is the insane reality. There is no use in dealing with a country whose evil regime is propped up by our wealth. We want things produced in China. The cost: China gets rich, murders her own people, genocides Muslims, harvests their organs, and let’s their people live in a manner that makes them a Petri dish for every single goddamn pandemic. All of this so that we can have an iPhone. I say fuck that. Send them the bill.
Today I interviewed Julian Wheatland. I’m not sure how much came out in this interview that is new information. I got the distinct impression that much of what Julian shared was shared by him at other times. That said, they were new to me. You can listen to the interview below. And underneath the embed, you I timestamp a few of the most interesting moments in the interview.
* 24:25 - I ask whetther psychographics should be considered a munitions. Julian responds, that “it’s absurd.” Because psychographics “isn’t that powerful.” It’s used by many enterprising advertising agencies. Also, they didn’t use psychographics on the Trump campaign.
* 28:14 - “Everything we did was nothing compared to what Jim Comey did… It was the first time there was a negative story about Hillary in the news and not a corresponding negative story about trump…. It was changing the way voting was happening….”
* 34:24 - Chris Wiley discussion. Needless to say, Wiley is the first CA whistlblower. He was not working at CA when the the activitty he alleged was happening. Moreover, he is the one that brought in the FB data that wasn’t ultimately used. After CA, Wiley left to start his own firm. He then pitched both the Brexit and Trump campaigns.
* 1:05:34 - Cambridge Analytica did delete the Facebook data after being asked. CA attempted to get an auditor from FB to come in and verify the deletion. The information commissioner quashed the audit, citing collusion concerns.
* 1:20:10 - Britany Kaiser left after she didn’t get a pay increase Wheatland believes she thought she deserved. Wheatland believes she felt financially well enough as a result of an ICO the company participatedin marketing in. Kayser was given coins from Dragon Coin ( ).
Post-interview, I’m left wondering where the due diligence was here. This entire story is as a public interest piece is predicated on the idea that the Trump campaign levereged ill-gotten Facebook data. But did the Trump campaign really do that? All of the evidence is based on claims made by a business development employee and a man who started a competing company. So how did this story begin? Was it a political hit job? To what end? For those of us who watched the CA story fromt he beginning, it seemingly came out of nowhere. The claims were and are astounding. Many believe the story wholesale. But the question that seems to have never been asked where is the evidence that anything nefarious happened at all?
Since Alex Jone’s was de-platformed, I have heard market-loving advocates talk about the necessity of a second YouTube. It’s a great idea. The sort of monopolization of the social media space is worrying. And de-platforming “dissident” content is unprecedented, for some (me included) it’s a bit scary. I don’t think that sequestering content as good and bad is necessarily a good thing. Perhaps it’s fine to do it with content we consider lewd or pornographic. But even that standard changes over time.
What’s more, there seems to be a movement underfoot that labels this “dissident content” as even worse than porn. When gun manufacturers and gun enthusiasts were purged from youtube post-Parkland ( ) , some of them moved to Pornhub ( ). The response from Pornhub was astounding. Mindgeek, the owner of basically every popular porn site in the US, quickly banned the gun content on its platform saying, “As a privately-held company that operates and manages many businesses and organizations within the adult film industry, we believe it is in our best interest to protect and serve our standing client base. The MindGeek group has labored tirelessly for many years to produce and erect a foundation of quality content for a specific group of customers. We do not believe this new segment of unique visitors is a part of that group we have pushed to acquire.”
The truly remarkable thing about Mindgeek is that they have successfully monetized the smut industry, as well. Certainly ads are much cheaper there ( ). But, let’s be honest, Mindgeek’s websites consume more bandwidth than (perhaps) any other websites on the globe. The users there are the same users that watch YouTube and peruse reddit. In August of 2017, it was reported that their revenues were in excess of $400 million in global subscriptions ( ) alone (people subscribe to porn?).
The reaction of MindGeek feels uncomfortable. It doesn’t make sense that companies that are making content that is on the periphery of free speech would cast aspersions at other content. But then, it’s not all that uncommon. Regarding Alex Jones, Howard Stern equated Jones’s content with “shouting fire in a crowded theater.” This from the man whose show thrived on punkish juveniles eschewing the rules of their parents to listen. Does Stern do real journalism? The answer is that it doesn’t matter. His right to make the content is a testament to the seriousness with which Americans take the first amendment. And that has always been the role of court jesters. The people we take the least seriously are the foils to the suits and tie wearing television news presenters. They sit on the periphery of content making showing society a mirror. One is allowed to make whatever content they please. And we are allowed to consume it or not consume it. The beauty of Stern’s platform is that he was a radio presenter. And it is hard, if not impossible, to prevent the incursion of radio signals into your space. HCJB ( ) uses radio to prosyletize. Pirate Radio ( ) was a famous station phenomenon in the 1960s in the UK. Jones, on the other hand, was using a private platform for broadcasting his content, which makes him susceptible to being shut down. And shutting down content that they don’t like might even be within their rights.
The problem here is that YouTube built it’s business on the back of content makers that have no skin in the game. While video remains one of the most expensive pieces of content to host, YouTube lets a family host their family videos at no cost. Content creators with no prospects store their footage on YouTube and stream without ever having to pay. YouTube doesn’t make money ( ). When Google bought the platform, the situation was no better.
Modern companies rely on the same economics of Ponzi schemes. The cycle of a company is to get an investment. The investment serves as a bridge to the next round of investment. At each round the company’s founders give up equity. Their goal is to grow the company as fast as they can. If they can show growth (even if they “burn” through more cash than the average person will ever see at any point in their life), they are able to raise another round. Ultimately, this culminates in one of two “liquidation events.” Either the company is acquired or the investors take it public and sell shares on the open market. YouTube sold in exchange for $1.65 billion worth of Google shares. This despite their waning revenues. And now, while Google doesn’t disclose the specific earnings of YouTube, it is widely speculated that the independent branch of Google is, at best, breaking even.
Moreover, and this is the disturbing bit of it, YouTube’s money comes from another strategic acquisition that Google made. Adwords, Google’s programmatic ad platform, is what allows YouTube to generate revenues from its content. Some of this money is shared with YouTube’s biggest content creators. Some of it goes back to YouTube. But make no bones about it, YouTube’s success is largely contingent on Google’s near monopolization of the online ad space. Simply, even if a website were to try to compete with YouTube, the only path to it is by burning huge amounts of cash, then either, IPO-ing or getting acquired. Who would acquire the platform? Another big tech company. What would happen if the company IPO’d? Well they would be reliant on some kind of programatic marketplace (almost certainly Google), and would 1) bring in a lot of investor money and 2) would slowly burn it to bankruptcy. There is almost no way to build a platform that is as capital intensive as YouTube, wherein there is no prospects of profits.
The best attempt I’ve seen so far is GodTube, which relies on its niche status as a video platform for Christians. This site has been through numerous iterations, and is private. I doubt they make money - though I can’t know for sure They claim to have over 1 million unique visitors each month - which some tools sort of confirm. They make money with ads… Guess which company serves their ads.
The problem with all this isn’t just the banning. It’s the power that the tech giants seem to have acquired. They can de-platform anyone or any business by kicking them off their platform by refusing to sell the website’s inventory. This means that in order for there to rise up a platform that can successfully compete with YouTube and be as profitable as YouTube, they will have to first start a programmatic ad marketplace, and then monetize their videos with it. Moreover, this analysis lacks any claims about Google’s scalability. Because the reason that Google can reduce the price of hosting the content is that Google operates at such scale, that it would be nearly impossible to host content as cheaply as they do. For evidence, just consider how crappy video players are that you encounter online. Even big news organizations seem incapable of serving videos without the video buffering every 30 seconds.
Alas, for the savvy among us, we will point to sites such as DailyMotion existing to prove that there are competitive alternatives. But consider the model for these sites that I articulated above. In 2009, 3 years after Google acquired YouTube, DailyMotion was promising profitability within a year ( ). At the time DailyMotion had about 36.2 million unique visitors. So what happened? In 2015, Forbes reported that DailyMotion had grown to 137 million unique visits per month. And despite their promise in 2009, as of 2015, DailyMotion “has yet make a profit with… $110 million annual revenue.” Where are their revenues now? Not sure. They were acquired by the public French media conglomerate “Vivendi.” DailyMotion’s revenues, much like YouTube’s revenues are wrapped into the parent company. Simply, analyzing their net revenues is a near impossibility.
It might be that free content is anti-competitive. It entrenches platforms that get scale, and it makes it impossible to respond to them by competing. The only way one would be able to host dissident content would be to require content makers to pay to host the video. And for those who want to understand the cost of hosting videos, look no further than sites that already do that. Wistia ( ) , for example, will only let you upload 10 videos for Anything more, you’ll have to start paying for the storage.
Does all that mean I don’t believe a competitor will arise? Well there are people far smarter than I who are apparently working on this problem. But I will put my stick in the ground to say that the prospect of a viable competitor to YouTube is not going to come from the expected places. “The market” can’t really deal with the state of online content at the moment. The barriers to entry are simply too great. Additionally, even if someone were able to build a video site at any scale, the possibility of that site not disappearing to bankruptcy or the financial necessity that a site of any scale would be wrapped into a large conglomerate where dissident and unpopular content wouldn’t be tolerated means that even a site that looks like it’s achieving competitive scale will be temporary at best.
If I’m right, things are truly in a sad state. Content isn’t safe. And things have to get worse and worse. Because if bad ideas aren’t allowed to be served up, then good ideas can’t dampen them out. So good luck everyone. I hope that someone can figure out how to build a network that competes with these platforms. But as it is, I simply don’t see how a pathway to a world of another competitive video site where content is served for free. Perhaps that’s what we’ll see. Maybe dissident content will be behind a paywall and all the world’s weirdos who have pornhub subscriptions can fund the free stuff. And the question would remain, how will un-curated, amateur content served for free, subsidized by Google’s scale not simply outcompete un-curated, amateur content that costs money. Whatever the answer, I think in this case, “the market” isn’t a sufficient answer.
Blockchains are a largely misunderstood bit of new technology. As banks and corporations pour in to the space, the skepticism of the new technology that plagued its early days is gone. Skepticism is replaced by a hopeful indifference about the limitations of the technology. Discussion, now, is infused with an impenetrable faith that blockchain will solve all the problems of modern databases architecture. This will be a Synopticon of considerations taking reports that are presented and critiquing the ideas within. And this will be the first report that we critique. We have selected it based on the prominent institution associated with it and its potential for impact on industry watchers and corporate decision makers.
This particular analysis dissects the Blockchain for Social Impact ( ) report released by a team from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. It is currently incomplete (about 20% done) and will be expanded on as I find time. The goal here is simply to help readers of these papers more thoroughly parse the claims within.
1.1 (analysis) This is a difficult mission. There is very little data in the industry, and doing a multi-variate analysis about what will and what will not succeed is virtually impossible. Given the history of bubbles like the .com era rise in stock prices, we must assume that projects that will fail have yet to see their end. Moreover, the rubrick of “social impact” is non-specific. That said, we will give the researchers the benefit of the doubt and see whether they achieve the ends they are setting out to achieve.
1.2 Proponents contend blockchain will touch, if not disrupt, every major industry and will even alter the way that people and societies interact. Technology that increases efficiency, reduces costs, and promotes transparency can have significant implications for sectors that are dedicated to driving social impact. The potential to transform systems and leapfrog infrastructure can enable solutions that previously weren’t thought to be possible.
1.2-1.3 (analysis) The report asks the right questions. Though there is little evidence that in the longrun, technologies, even groundbreaking ones, can add more than a few points of efficiency to markets. Warren Buffett describes this effect in his speech at Sun Valley in 1999. After pointing out that the airline industry was destined to improve our lives to an incredible degree, or that radio and television manufacturing should have done the same, he says that none of the industry-leading companies of the time returned the kinds of money to investors that the contribution of the industry as a whole would lead one to believe. He says, rather, “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.”
1.4 This report is a result of an analysis of 193 organizations, initiatives, and projects that are leveraging blockchain to drive social impact. By mapping and cataloguing the landscape of such blockchain applications, our research captured which applications have already begun to demonstrate proven social impact, which industries and use cases are more or less advanced, and what we should be learning from the hundreds of test cases, pilots, and experiments that are using blockchain for social impact.
1.5 A steady surge in new projects, organizations, and platforms oriented toward the use of blockchain technology began in 2013 and has grown at an accelerating pace. This research has identified dozens of new ideas for how to use the technology for social impact (54 in 2016, 64 in 2017) — reflecting several new ideas each month, with likely many more currently in stealth mode.
1.4-1.5 (analysis) This report will hinge entirely on the definition of “blockchain.” If the premise is accepted that any organization claiming to use a blockchain is using a blockchain, then this will degrade quickly into the realm of nonsense. The idea that stealth development is being practiced by organizations developing applications for “social impact” is striking, however. Presumably these are not for profits. Why would a not-for-profit corporation seeking to impact the public good need to develop solutions in secret? Perhaps we will find out.
2.1 We’re still in the early days of blockchain for good, but impact is close. Blockchain initiatives dedicated toward social impact are still in the early days — 34% were started in 2017 or later, and 74% are still in the pilot or idea stage. But, 55% of social-good blockchain initiatives are estimated to impact their beneficiaries by early 2019.
2.2 Democracy and Governance initiatives are the furthest along, with 62% of all projects expected to have demonstrated impact in the next six months. On the other hand, 63% of Energy initiatives are not expected to see demonstrated impact within the next two years.
2.3 The Estonian government’s early adoption (in 2008) is the most advanced example of a government leveraging blockchain technology to enhance government services, with 99% of the country’s government services available as e-services through e-Estonia. These services leverage distributed ledger databases to lead to increased security, efficiency, and accessibility. (See case study on page 22.)
2.2-2.3 (analysis) Here we have the definition of a blockchain. And, as was stated earlier, this will likely be the crux of the analysis. It is widely acknowledged that Bitcoin is the world’s first blockchain. Bitcoin’s interesting structure and solution to collaborative consensus known as Proof of Work (POW) are what made it new. Computer databases, on the other hand, have existed since the 1980s. The idea of time stamping entries has been around for just as long. And the idea of merklizing entries and tracking their history has been around since the early days of the internet. SSL certificates do this. Git, the software management tool, does this. The staggering oversight of this author’s papers is in their claim that Estonia has been using a blockchain since 2008. Yet Bitcoin, the first blockchain, did not exist until 2009. As such, it can be assumed that none of the modern architecture of “blockchain,” the elements that make the technology “possibly revolutionary” are being considered in the projects this paper is purportedly analyzing. What is certainly true is that if all of the projects analyzed here are using technology that falls outside of the definition of blockchain, or that does not incorporate actual advances given us by the Bitcoin blockchain, then the question of “what makes these not simple databases” and “what is new here” must be both asked and answered.
2.4 Blockchain enables solutions not previously possible. Of the blockchain initiatives researched, 20% are providing a solution to a problem that could otherwise not have been solved without blockchain, and 86% are bringing forward solutions that are material improvements.
2.4 (analysis) This is based on a self-reported survey that asked the companies whether their solution required blockchain or not. 14% say that “Blockchain is one way to solve their problem, but others may be better.” And only 20% say that “blockchain is a necessity for solving their problem.” The other 66% say that blockchain is an improvement over other solutions. Presuming this paper allows us to follow these cohorts, these distinctions are the ones that we will most scrutinize.
2.5 BanQu is a U.S.-based company that uses blockchain to provide economic passports to those in need of a digital identity, which include unbanked populations, refugees, and micro-businesses operating in the world’s poorest regions. BanQu’s secure and accessible blockchain-based platform (accessible via SMS, smartphone, or web) allows the unbanked and the poor to record their economic and financial transactions, purchase goods, and prove their existance in global supply chains. (See case study on page 29.)
2.6 The health sector has attracted more initiatives than any other sector. Of catalogued blockchain initiatives, 25% were focused on health, which is nearly twice as much as the next leading sector, financial inclusion (13%). Energy, Climate, and Environment (12%) and Philanthropy, Aid, and Donors (11%) were the next highest.
2.7 Modum.io is a Zurich-based startup that combines hardware sensors with blockchain technology to track temperatures of medicinal products across the supply chain. Modum.io has completed three pilot projects, and its first-generation sensors are now in mass production, being deployed as part of several new pilots with primarily European-based companies. (See case study on page 51.)
2.8 Blockchain is most often used to facilitate payments and verify records. The most common use cases for blockchain initiatives are payments and money transfers (25%) and records and verification (26%). Blockchain’s most popular primary benefits are being able to reduce risk and fraud (38%) and increase efficiency (24%)
2.9 Mojaloop, an open-source payment platform developed by the Level One Project at the Gates Foundation, seeks to link financial institutions and payment providers to facilitate payments and information sharing through blockchain. Mojaloop uses blockchain to enable interoperability between financial institutions, which can speed up transaction times to a matter of milliseconds. The increase in inefficiency can lower costs and expand access to financial services to the unbanked. (See case study on page 43.)
3.0 Certain sectors see more for-profit activity than others. Overall, 61% of the initiatives catalogued are for-profit. The sectors with the most for-profit initiatives are those with the greatest commercial opportunity: Energy (94%), Health (87%), and Financial Inclusion (78%). Conversely, the sectors driven by nonprofit or public funding activity are those traditionally rooted in nonprofit or government activity: Philanthropy, Aid, and Donors (76%) and Democracy and Governance (33%).
2.5-2.8 (analysis) We will refrain from commenting on these corporate uses until the case studies are presented other than to say that the regular use of the present tense in this paper is presumptive and biased. The authors seem to be begging the question, assuming that blockchain is useful for these applications.
3.2 Bitcoin first emerged in the fall of 2008, and the Bitcoin network came into existence in early 2009. Bitcoin became the first decentralized digital currency, which means it is a digital “cash” system that allows people to exchange money instantly, without having to go through intermediaries like banks. Even digital payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo still route transfers through banks, incurring fees and time delays.
3.2 (analysis) If it is known to the writers of this paper that Bitcoin is the progenitor of “blockchain technology” then how are they including in this analysis projects that have existed before Bitcoin’s existence such as the Estonian Governments block-chaining of citizen information?
3.3 Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but its creation has led to over 1,500 cryptocurrencies that get purchased and traded globally: Ether (from Ethereum), XRP (from Ripple), and Litecoin are just a few examples. The “crypto” in cryptocurrency comes from the use of cryptography, which is used to solve several core problems in transferring money over the internet, eliminating the unauthorized creation of new money (referred to as “double-spend”), and giving users a secure way to prove their identities and transact with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary.
3.4 It is important to separate cryptocurrencies from blockchain, which is the underlying technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. A blockchain is a digital, secure, public record book of transactions (a ledger). “Block” describes the way this ledger organizes transactions into blocks of data, which are then organized in a “chain” that links to other blocks of data. The links make it easy to see if anyone has changed any part of the chain, which helps the system protect against illegal transactions.
3.4 (analysis) This explanation divorces the innovation of a database that tracks changes from the innovation that allows that database to be held by multiple disparate parties who are working toward their own enrichment, yet still update the database with an honest state. This is the innovation of Bitcoin. Anything else existed before blockchain.
3.5 Over the past few years, blockchain has revolutionized access to capital for new ventures. In 2017 alone, blockchain-based startups raised close to $4 billion through a process known as an “ICO” (initial coin offering) or a Token Generating Event. In this process, a blockchain startup issues its own digital currency, known as “tokens,” and sells them to either private or public investors. Tokens have value because the issuer requires that future customers pay for services rendered using these tokens. The types of services vary; this could be computing resources, data storage space, peer-to-peer home sharing, advertisement space, or medical data. Given that the supply of tokens is fixed, this creates a demand for tokens that creates a priceable market. These types of tokens are known as “utility tokens.” There are other types of tokens, like security tokens, which can be used to represent equity shares. Another type, called digital collectible tokens, are unique tokens that can represent scarce digital goods like collectible cards, in-game items, or other collectibles.
3.6 The process of issuing tokens became orders of magnitude simpler thanks to the Ethereum network, which made it easy for developers to code their own tokens in twenty minutes or less instead of writing custom code, and it provided a simple way to deploy tokens using a smart contract. A “smart contract” is a piece of software code that gets written into the blockchain, and different applications can reference this code. When an application utilizes a smart contract, it can process counterparty transactions automatically, without human interference; for example, when the application detects that certain conditions are met (e.g. money has been received from someone), an event is triggered (e.g. send money to someone else).
3.4-3.6 (analysis) This is a unsophistocated analysis of what has happened in the last year. Ethereum’s ERC20 protocol did not make it easier than previous solutions, though it did allow people to agree to a standard of token creation. Again, the analysis here is begging the question. It assumes these token generation events are: 1) legal, 2) good, 3) different than what exists 4) useful. As to whether they are legal, the jury is out. The SEC has been sending mixed signals. [citation] As to whether they are good is unknowable at the moment. And as to whether they are different than what exists is almost certainly untrue. World of Warcraft, for exapmle, has had issued currency in-game for more than a decade. Additionally, Second Life’s Linden Dollars have been traded like Bitcoin and other crypto currencies on exchanges. All the while, they exist on a centralized ledger. As to whether these tokens are useful, the report touts their manufactured utility within the framework of a developed ecosystem. In the way that arcades lock up a visitor’s capital so that a culture of captive users is created, additionally reducing capital costs by allowing machines to be manfuactured without concern for the kind of currency that is being put in them, it is a highly suspect claim that this sort of arcade mentality is more efficient or even useful for a business. For example, is it better for Facebook to issue Facebook tokens or is it better for Facebook to accept and pay out US dollars? To accept as fact that issuing Facebook tokens is more efficient, more profitable, and more useful is presumptuous and unproven. It belies the complications of monetary systems and their management.
3.7 There are three key elements needed to establish trust: 1) identity, or who’s who; 2) ownership, or who owns what; and 3) verification, or what’s true. Blockchains allow users to easily prove their identities, protect ownership of digital assets, and verify transactions without a high-cost intermediary.
3.7 (analysis) The identify funciton of a blockchain is simply cryptography. It is not endemic to a blockchain. It is the result of individuals signing messages that reveal their possession of a public identifier. Blockchain is not necessarily the source of this innovation. Rather, this was made possible in 1976 when Diffie and Hellman invented public-key encryption. Its ease of implementation and use as a means to establish ownership of a private key was furthered by Phil Zimmermann when PGP was released in 1991. When it comes to blockchain, this establishment of one’s ownership of a public key does, indeed, purport ownership. THe blockchain tracks what tokens are associated with which public address. The identity portion gives control of those tokens to the individual or individuals who can sign the transaction verifying their possession of the number the tokens are on. But the third bit of this, the fact that blockchains purport truth, is only true insofar as the information that is entered into them is true. Simply, using blockchains for tracking provenance requires that the entry of the data be honest. Otherwise, the provenance will articulate the data that is put in truly, but it will promulgate bad data. Thus, the source of the truth matters as much as the truth keeping function of the ledger. Moreover, while Bitcoin’s Proof of Work implements a cost function that makes changing the data that is in the blockchain prohibitively expensive, most internal “blockchains” do not implement this same function. This means, simply, the notion that these projects are secured because blockchain is questionable. Rather, they are more likely secured in the way that organizations have always secured databases - through obfuscation and digital security. As such, it is questionable whether these blockchains are blockchains in name only or whether they are actually architected in a way that reflects the benefits that blockchain would bestow on a database. It is likely that these chains are nothing more than databases that track changes through time stamping.
3.8 Who’s Who: Blockchains solve the identity problem through the use of digital signatures. Each user is given a set of two digital codes (a “private key,” similar to an account number, and a “public key,” similar to a password) that allows them to easily prove an identity and issue authorized transactions.
3.8 (analysis) A private key is more like a password, in that it is kept private. A public key is more like an account number in that it is the place where funds exist. But the analogies are not perfect. The private key is used to sign and verify ownership of the public key.
3.9 Who Owns What: Blockchains solve the ownership problem through a technology called “cryptographic hashing.” A cryptographic hash is simply a piece of data that has been run through a math function and transformed into a shorter piece of data. In a blockchain, each block contains a hashed representation of the data in the previous block. If you change any previous pieces of data, that change will get reflected throughout the chain, making it easy for the system to see and reject fraudulent attempts to manipulate the data. This allows blockchains to create “immutable” data, otherwise known as tamper-proof records.
3.10 What’s True: And, finally, blockchains solve the verification problem by making it feasible for a group of people to publicly verify that a transaction is true, without the need for a trusted intermediary. In blockchain terminology, this is called “distributed consensus.” The ability for blockchains to verify transactions with fewer intermediaries is a key benefit that can lead to lower costs for many applications in this report.
3.10 (analysis) There is no reason that substituting the need for a single verifier of a state is more efficient than utilizing multiple verifiers. A blockchain is not more efficient as a tool of verified truth than a database managed by a single entity. Moreover, the process of coming to consensus is expensive. It is not as simple as all the participants signing off on the data. Blockchains are the solution to a complicated problem called the Byzantine General problem. The problem is a thought experiment that contrives a battle wherein all the generals must agree to behave in a given way even if some of the generals work against the group. Incidentally, this problem is why blockchain is excellent as a bearer instrument. While it behooves an individual in the system to move money from one place back to them, the nature of the ledger punishes corruption fo the data by not paying the creator of the data if the data is not accepted by the rest of the system. The process of coming to this consensus is difficult and expensive.
3.11 Blockchain’s potential is rooted in enabling four things. Transparency: Anyone with access to the network can view a history of transactions in real time. Potential impact: The money trail can be tracked and monitored more accurately in areas like aid distribution.
3.12 Immutability: Blockchains protect data from tampering; no one entity is able to change past data without alerting the network. Potential impact: Immutability protects areas like voter authentication and land title registrations.
3.13 Reduced counterparty risk (and subsequently lower cost payments): Blockchains allow anyone to send money to anyone without an expensive or corrupt intermediary. Potential impact: Money sent across borders or into natural disaster zones will move quickly. In addition, many critical elements of our economy allow people to trade with each other without fear that the other party will back out. Banks perform this function, but often add high administration costs and slow processing times into the system. Blockchain’s smart contracts guarantee that a contract will be fulfilled when a specific action is completed. Potential impact: Eliminating intermediaries reduces counterparty risk, thus reducing costs.
3.13 (analysis) Intermediaries are necessary functional pieces of an economy. The irony embedded in the elimination of intermediaries is that this is synonymous with claiming blockchains kill jobs. But more than that, it belies the functions of intermediaries. Intermediaries do not exist to extract rent, generally. The function of an intermediary is to make a transaction cheaper. For example, one can remove intermediaries from tomato farming. The result would be that a farmer would need to harvest his own tomatoes. He would need to pack them into his own truck. He would need to drive that truck somewhere. He would then need to sell them himself. In the exchange of tomatoes, however, huge efficiencies have been achieved through the rise of intermediaries. A company comes to the famer’s farm and picks up the tomatoes. This company picks up this farmer’s tomatoes and his neighbors and his neighbor’s tomatoes. These tomatoes are driven from the farm to a central sorting facility. This facility sorts the tomatoes based on size, weight, looks, etc. These tomatoes are transferred from the factory to stores all over the United States and sold at a pittance. This is an absurd reduction of the process, insofar as one must acknowledge all the intermediaries involved in the process of delivering the gas that the vehicles run on, and the creation of the equipment that the farmer farms on, and the generation and science involved in the seed the farmer planted that generate higher yields. In all, intermediaries are not a grand evil. Even in the case of disaster relief, while it might be true that transmitting money over blockchain would quickly get the money from one spot to another, the money will still need to be transmitted to an intermediary that will handle the relief work. In fact, the very act of sending money to disaster zones is an acknowledgement that intermediaries are necessary. One sends money in order to vitiate the need for their labor to be put into solving the problem.
3.14 Efficient provisioning of identities. Blockchains can create and manage identities for people in a lower cost, secure way through digital signature technology, which gives people a public key (similar to an account number) and a private key (similar to a password)Potential impact: Underserved populations, like the unbanked, receive access to services never before possible.
4.1 Investments in blockchain for agriculture are in their early stages, but they have the potential to impact the lives of large numbers of people. Although nearly 90% of Agriculture initiatives are headquartered in Europe, Australia, or the United States, and 50% of implementations are in these same regions, another 30% of the implementations are in sub-Saharan Africa.
4.2 The primary uses can improve traceability, transparency, and efficiency for actors across the entire supply chain, from farmers to consumers. To achieve those improvements, Agriculture initiatives must overcome the siloing of actors along the supply chain.
4.1-4.2 (analysis) Provenance blockchain initiatives generally fail to account for the centralization of data inputs. These inputs are where corruption can easily occur ( ) Simply, decentralization does not solve the problem of dishonesty. With a bearer bond, that honesty can be dire. When a thief sends money from an honest actor to himself, everyone will verify the fact that the bearer instrument is now the bad actor’s. This is an inconvenient truth asserted by a bad actor, but it is truth nonetheless. That said, putting into the blockchain, “God exists” does not attest to the validity of the statement. Rather, it simply attests to the fact that the statement is in the chain. This reality makes provenance a very difficult problem that Blockchain can not solve simply.
4.3 As agricultural supply chains are structured today, compliance data (such as data on safety, sustainability, and certificate status of food products) is stored on paper or in a proprietary database, which is audited periodically by trusted third parties. This structure results in costly operational management and high potential for fraud, corruption, or error (both human and technology-based).
4.4 Food contamination and food fraud affect both consumers and producers. The WHO estimates that one in 10 people fall ill every year from eating contaminated foods. The economic cost is estimated by the Grocery Manufacturers Association to be $10–15 billion per year, with a single food fraud incident costing 2–15% of a company’s annual revenue.
4.5 In order to reduce food fraud and contamination and increase transparency and efficiency, for-profit companies are driving 60% of Agriculture applications for blockchain. Blockchain replaces the trusted-yet-fallible third parties involved in collecting, tracking, and managing data within agricultural supply chains with more neutral and efficient systems.
4.3-4.5 (analysis) This is a highly irresponsible set of assertions. Blockchain does not analyze the quality of food. Blockchain does not analyze the quality of a supply chain. Blockchain can not audit itself. Perhaps, the existence of a less obfuscated database would solve some of these problems. But, in reality, this is untenable as a claim as those who have access to the database would likely not have better information about the supply chain than those regulating or currently checking the database.
4.6 Farmers benefit as well as distributors. Although the large majority of Agriculture use cases identified in our research focused on supply chain management, 20% focused on payments and money transfers, applications that help ensure that farmers receive timely and complete payments for their crops.
4.6 (analysis) Statements about who can benefit from this technology are inappropriate in this paper given the scope of the study. This paper is attempting to analyze the stated objectives of projects. However, the authors regularly interject assertions about the benefits of these projects.
4.7 Investments in blockchain for Agriculture are early stage. Most initiatives are less than two years old, and none are currently reaching more than 1,000 beneficiaries; 93% are either in concept stage or have started a small pilot.
4.7 (analysis) The paper analyzes their data. This less than 1,000 people is highly biased. The study does not attempt to uncover how small these projects actually are. Rather, 53% of these projects are reaching less than 1,000 people. 47% are either currently in concept phase or did not have information available. So, while 100% of the respondents are accounted for here, it seems likely that 100% of these projects are almost certainly much smaller than one might assume given that fewer than 1,000 people is a small number and a category that (apparently) subsumes the entirety of projects that have gone beyond the concept phase.
4.8 For blockchain to be implemented in any supply chain, engagement across the full supply chain would be required, meaning each farmer, distributor, packager, and other agricultural supply chain actors must be willing to adopt and use the technology. Blockchain technologies also require internet connections and digital literacy for widespread adoption; this remains a challenge in some emerging markets, as well as in rural areas of developed countries, where many farmers and producers are located.
4.8 (analysis) This is obvious. Throughout this paper the notional value of a blockchain is that it solves the problem with human coordination. Businesses go to great lengths to solve human coordination problems. Marketing is generally used to overcome barriers to human coordination. Blockchains do not solve the problem of human coordination. In order to get uptake, it is still necessary for people to adopt a technology. Moreover, should an industry agree on a standard to track and monitor provenance, the problem of honesty of data oracles is still not solved. Moreover, one must question why this is better done as a blockchain and not as a simple centralized database run by a company. Even more than that, being that 75% of the respondents in this study are for-profit companies, one must question the truth of the claim regarding the need for decentralized coordination. It is likely that many corporations competing for business to optimize the supply chain will end in many different solutions to optimizing the supply chain and a fractured industry that picks one solution over another. This fractious problem solving will be further complicated by the insertion of more intermediaries to either coordinate between solutions, implement the solutions in the first place, or it could end in the solutions being unusable due to fractious consumers making choices about what suits their needs. This is a far worse solution than the coordination that occurs through market competition and the necessity of solutions that arise from experienced operators in an industry.
In a recent NYT article, Antony J. Blinken discusses how Trump could gerrymander his way to winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The fact that the Peace Prize is even on the table is a hilarious reality for much of America. There is a vocal group of ingrates who would have others believe, and who believe themselves, that Trump is hated by everyone. Certainly, Trump enjoys more vitriol than past Presidents. But, while that may be true, I am always left perplexed by the nature of criticisms against him. I do my best to be a-political, and often do not succeed. But his sins, while more mortal than venial, are difficult to parse when the position of his critics is largely assessed.
Trump’s affairs, for example, have taken the limelight. But it is the left that supported Clinton’s known philandering, Kennedy’s penchant for young dames, and Roman Polansky’s pursuit of a 13 year old whom he, forgive the short-hand, Bill Cosbied. Given these heroes of the modern left, it is hard to stomach the critique of our President. While a public philanderer, Trump’s trists have both been known and well documented. Throughout the 90s, leftists were asking when the businessman would run. Trump’s recent trist with a porn star is as public as ever. But, while everyone acknowledges the depravity of Trump’s dealings and the emotional toll on Melania - his wife - the crime is a chasmic prosecutorial reach that relies on semantics and optics rather than the thing itself. This, to me, is astounding though not unprecedented.
The other scandals may have more legs. Trump’s dealings with Russia, for example, are known and documented. Whether there is a crime in those dealings is another matter entirely. But that is what is being investigated.
When it comes to Trump’s foreign policy, there are the supposed bungles that plague his administration. First and foremost is his alleged reference to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries.” The designation is humorous in its insightfulness and undiplomatic and inexact in its wordchoice. That said, in the days following the scandal, Anderson Cooper ran a piece ( ) wherein he attempted to defenstrate Mr. Trump’s foreign policy credentials by telling a touching story about how he went to Haiti. The strength of the people was articulated in their ability to withstand governmental corruption. Which Cooper seems to think is rampant. He describes Haiti as a place where the government has “abandoned its people, where opportunities are few, and where mother nature has punished the people far more than anyone should be punished.” He tells a story about displacement and death in the wake of an earthquake that leveled the nation largely due to a lack of acceptable building codes. And when Haiti is not dealing with governmental corruption, its people are subject to some of the most dehumanizing conditions in the Western hemisphere. This is the country where the people eat cookies made of dirt and clay. In a 2009 interview ( ) , Joel Boutroue of the United Nations mission to Haiti says that the country, “3.3 million Haitians are food insecure… around 25% of the children are chronically malnurished… the same indicators as in sub-Saharan Africa.”
Certainly, this language is more diplomatic. But it is hard to find great praise directed at the nation. And perhaps, Trump’s use of the shorthand “shithole country” makes him a crappy diplomat. But I’m not sure how it is any different than describing the nation as run by a corrupt government that has abandoned its people, where economic opportunities are virtually non-existent, where the country is regularly devastated by natural events such as weather and earthquake (while its island counterpart, the Dominican Republic remains relatively intact), and where it’s people eat cookies made of dirt for sustenance. How is that a more inviting description? Trump’s comments are a simple precis of Cooper’s points, and a simple summation about the feelings of most Americans. They do not make our relationship with Haiti any worse. After all, Haiti is a net recipient of aid and not exactly the best exporter of the product. And there are African nations that are in a similar boat. That’s unequivocal. Somalia, for example, is overrun by pirates. It’s per capita GDP is $300 lower than Haiti’s.
To wit, Trump’s comments could more easily be interpreted as shorthand for “there are countries that are struggling and continue to need our aid” than its racist alternative which many in the media repeated. That is if he even said it. Keep in mind that it was a report about someone’s reporting that captured the news cycle with regard to the comments. And while no one would be surprised if Trump confirmed the phrase was his, there was no charity in the interpretation of the alleged words. For Trump, it would seem, confirming words said in a private meeting would be as useful as publicly announcing a particularly noxious rectal escape. There is little doubt it would dominate the news cycle as well.
Certainly, Trump has his flaws. Some of them are eggregious. But his flaws, it seems, are in his unwillingness to bend himself to the mise-en-scène. Then again, if Trump’s support was something like 50% of the nation, it would seem worth acknowledging that the percieved mise-en-scène may actually be nothing more than the result of a highly vocal half of the country. Perhaps, the Eloi have taken over and subjugated the Morlocks to the deep earth. Perhaps, it is difficult to understand the cultural milieu when you ignore the other half. Then again, perhaps not. But it’s at least worth considering.
But a myopic look at American sentiments toward Mr. Trump belies the point. While many Americans might find it difficult to stomach a world where Mr. Trump is considered for a Nobel prize, we have to acknowledge that the prize is an international one. The prize is to be given to the person “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” That is a high calling. Many years, the prize goes to someone whom has not explicitly done anything like that. In 2007, former Vice President Al Gore shared the prize with the IPCC after his documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” was released to international acclaim. And while it can be argued that the work recognized his life’s work, it is difficult to see how his award in any way fulfilled the mission of the prize except in an oblique sense. Climate change is a global problem, thus we must work together to solve it. Perhaps it was Mr. Gore’s influence on global consensus that stands as the basis. But I do not believe that he set out to win the prize, nor ever considered that he might given the subject of his passion.
I do not stand as a critic of the award either. It is an annual award. In some years, the pool of candidates that have explicitly accomplished the mission of the prize is simply more shallow than others. In some ways this gives the Nobel prize some flexibility in its ability to make statements. Gore’s award, I’m certain, was a statement. And there have been similar, other statements over the years. In 1999, for example, Doctors Without Borders was given the prize. While I may be unaware of their efforts, as I understand it, Doctors Without Borders performs medicine with qualified doctors in zones where medicine is hard to get. This is a worthwhile effort and it is commendable. Many doctors have died while working for the organization. I can’t imagine a more courageous group of people. But they are not explicitly working for toward the fraternity of nations. They are not abolishing or reducing standing armies. They certainly aren’t promoting peace congresses. And this is where the criticism of the right rings so loudly. Obama’s prize in 2009 was given as the result of Obama’s claims that he was working to reduce nuclear weapons. But for the most part, I think it can be acknowledged, his award was more like a collective thanks given on behalf of his not being George Bush. As to whether Obama lived up to the expectations foisted on him by the win is for you to decide.
Perhaps my favorite example of a prize winner is 1970’s Norman Borlaug. Borlaug’s award is a testament to American inginuity. The man single handedly increased grain yields through science by such an extent that countries today are self-sufficient. He is so specifically and personally responsible for reducing hunger and famine by such a degree that it may be worth crediting him for saving more lives than any human that ever lived. At the very least it puts him on par with such magicians as Pascal or Jenner. Perhaps that’s overstating his contribution. But I don’t think it is. While obscure, Borlaug’s efforts are imminently tied to the mission of the prize. His midwestern life, humble upbringing, tireless pursuit of truth, and willingness to share saved lives. His knowledge, was, perhaps, America’s greatest export. He helped wean entire nations off of subsistance living, and greatly contributed to ushering in the modern era of productivity. In 1972, no prize was issued. And, I think it’s worth noting, in 1973, Henry Kissinger was awarded the prize along with Le Duc Tho who turned it down. While I’m not sure what the criticism are, I imagine they are plentiful and merciless. Though it was far less controversial when he received it as numerous biographies are happy to describe.
In 1994, Yasser Arafat was given the prize. The man, who famously addressed the UN while wearing a pistol, received the prize for his efforts to bring peace to the middle east. He shared the prize with Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. Arafat, in some ways, was a dark horse winner. While instrumental in the Oslo Accords, Arafat was the organizer and leader of a guerilla group that carried out thousands of attacks on Israel… thousands.
And that brings us to Antony J. Blinken’s article in the New York Times today. Antony is certainly correct in his sentiment that Trump could do more to negotiate global peace. Yes, a deal with Iran would be a boon. But given the history of the prize, it would seem that the Nobel committee has always acknowledged massive political wins. Arafat’s guerilla group, for example, carried out thousands of attacks on Israelis. His prize was given for his efforts to end the attacks that he, himself was responsible for. And in some ways, while it’s easy to criticize the committee for what might seem a sort of tautological award, this is the nature of foreign policy. Arafat believed that force was necessary in securing peace. Was he right? Perhaps. But his efforts did end in some menial progress in the region. Many died on the road to that progress, however. But the menial progress made in a small region of the world was and remains a significant piece in the mythical museum of totemic foreign policy history. Even in so far as Arafat’s efforts have proven innefective, he was awarded the prize. And he’s not the only despotic victor. Lê Duc Tho had his flaws. And Cordell Hull in 1939 famously sent a ship filled with nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees back to Germany. He was awarded the prize in 1945 for his work in creating the UN.
So what will be the most significant foreign policy event of 2018? In some ways, it’s an irrelevant question. As has been the historical precedent, the Nobel prize is not always reserved for those whom fulfill its stated purpose. But in those years where the prize’s mission is so obviously fulfilled, it becomes difficult to reason why it would be given to anything other than the architect of that event. And thus, we arrive at the current state of North and South Korea. These two nations have been at nuclear loggerheads for 68 years. Until last week, there was no end in sight. Enter Trump. No analysis of the events is complete without an acknowledgement of his unorthodox approach to foreign policy. Perhaps the most excoriated bit of Trump’s method was his tweet ( ) wherein he referenced the president of North Korea by name: “Kim Jon Un.” The tweet seems maniacal, psychopathic on first glance. But it is a bit whitty and even slightly clever. He does not, for example, tweet @ Kim. But rather, requests that someone from his “depleted and food starved regime” inform him that Mr. Trump has a nuclear button backed by an arsenal of well kept, working nukes. The humor is in Trump’s ability to point out the fact that Kim may not even be able to know the tweet has been sent from his palace overseeing a Kingdom with the amenities of a practically pre-Victorian world. The only modern convenience that North Koreans seem to enjoy is their seeming ability to manipulate nuclear bombs to explosion. It’s an impressive feat for a nation that is perceived as being so backward its people are purported to believe their leader doesn’t even have a butthole, or at the very least, never uses it ( ). And what of Un’s incredible penscient for cruelty ( ). It has been reported that he killed his uncle. And we have all seen the video of the state sponsored murder of his brother. Reportedly, a standing order to assassinate Kim Jong-nam (his brother) was in existence since 2012 because, “I just hate him. So get rid of him.” ( )
Whether that’s the true reason or not is hard to say. But what is obvious is that the world viewed Kim as a murderous tyrant not just two weeks ago. His Southern counterparty, however, is much different. A recent ascender to the Presidency, South Korea’s Moon Jae-in was voted in after his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, was impeached then jailed for abuse of power, bribery, coercion, and leaking government secrets. For those unfamiliar with the Korean situation, there is a deep sense of mourning that South Koreans have about the state of the Nation to their North. To them, it is still Korea. Speak to a Korean, you will see a longing in their eyes as they discuss the someday, far-off, hope that they have that the Koreas will one day be reunited.
Then suddenly, we all wake up one morning and peace is at hand. For me, at least, it was that sudden. And in the interim, we begin hearing leaks about how Trump was instrumental in making it happen. And certainly, it is important to acknowledge North Korea’s history in respecting these types of deals. But never before has Un been a party to the negotiations. Some, including myself, believe that Kim has very Western sensibilities. His despotic tendencies are more of a necessity than a deeply ingrained personality trait. The murder of his uncle and his brother, some have suggested, are related to a far-reaching coup plot. It is to say that in a regime like North Korea, Kim likely has more fears than your average leader. The Kim family’s infighting is a legendary ( ) , remarkable reality when considering the longevity of their reign. Not to mention their geopolitical placement. Sandwiched between China and Russia, indebted to both in many ways, the country is in a precarious place. What’s to be done?
So as Trump fanned the Hawkish flames, and Americans feared the worst, it would seem that his backchannel negotiations were far different, perhaps even more civil, than the public facing rhetoric. They dangled the ultimate prize in front of Kim: a chance to meet and negotiate with the Chief Executive Officer of the world’s most powerful nation. In the end, the pressure, the personal issues, the unknowns pushed Kim to seek piece with his southern counterpart. And while it’s notable that the US does have interests in the region, there are no obvious gains to peace between the Koreas other than for the two nations. This is unprecedented, in some ways. It is an important point in the discussion regarding the Nobel prize as well. Certainly, history would seem to favor a shared prize between the individuals who negotiated peace. Arafat, for example, shared his prize with his Oslo Accord manufacturing and signing counterparts. In this case, it would not be surprising if the award were shared by Un, Jae-in, and perhaps Trump. But while Korea has tried at peace for 68 years, it has never happened. No man or woman has ever been able to orchestrate productive talks between the two nations, no man, that is, until Donald Trump, surprising as it may be. And this is why Trump, and only Trump, must be given the prize. He is the catalyst and orchestrator of this peace initiative. And it is nothing short of miraculous. And yes, Mr. Blinken, we must see where the dust settles. But, like with the reporting of Trumps comments about Haiti, we must be charitable in our understanding of the situation. This time things truly are different. Even if talks stall, there must be acknowledgement that this time is not like the other times. Un is not Il. And Trump is not like the others that have negotiated with the regime. Not to mention that among the list of recipients, there are very few who have so perfectly filled out the criteria.
Ask yourself, who has done the most or the best work to promote fraternity between nations in 2018? The answer is undoubtedly Mr. Trump. Divorce yourself from the invectives about his comments about Haiti or Moslems or Africa. While there might be arguments about why those comments make the world less safe, the evidence is tenuous at best. And while it may be damaging politically, Trump’s comments have done almost nothing in the grand scheme of global relations. Nations that have always received financial aid are still pretty much receiving it. Nations that have not, aren’t. Nothing much has changed there.
Ask yourself, who has done the most for the abolition and reduction of standing armies or for the holding and promotion of peace congresses? Again the answer is undoubtedly Donald Trump. Jae-In and Un met because of his pressure campaign. Trump and his team are the orchestrators of peace between those two nations. And while the others are playing an important role, Trump’s role was pivotal. Nothing would have started without him. And before we begin arguing for Moon and Kim’s prizes, perhaps it is worth acknowledging that Moon himself believes that Trump’s role was so pivotal as to deserve the prize ( ).
Ultimately, the prize doesn’t matter. The fact remains that Trump has won a foreign policy coup that others have only ever dreamt of. Winning the Nobel prize or not doesn’t change that. But the reason that this discussion must be had is because of how clear it is that Trump should win. Generally, when there is an award, given for something, there are three or four or five people who seem equally qualified to receive it. Very rarely is one so head and shoulders above his competitors that it is just obvious. It happens occasionally, and when it does we are struck by a global sense of dispair. The olympics, for example, has occasionally been plagued with such scandals, such as in Roy Jone’s loss to Park Si-Hun in 1988 in the sport of boxing ( ). And as I hear people begin to make arguments about why Trump should not be given the Nobel, such as Mr. Blinken’s allegation that he must do more in a completely unrelated region regarding a completely different problem in order to be eligible is laughable. Moreover, the claim is unexamined. Were Trump, in a single year, to negotiate peace between the Koreas and to stop proliferation of nukes in Iran, that would not make him more qualified for the prize. It would simply make not giving it to him even more laughable than it already will be.
Bitcoin is hard enough. It’s rocket science. How it works, why it works, whether it works are both difficult to ascertain as well as difficult and to understand at even a surface level. Take, for example, the recent mining of the 17 millionth Bitcoin. James Lopp has a great Twitter ( ) thread describing how hard it is to even know how many coins have been mined. Nothing in Bitcoin is cut and dry. Everything is probabilistic. Nothing is easy to track or understand. Every decision miners make (when they are professional miners) is in dedication to making money. That is their role here. That is the only reason they mine at all. They aren’t benevolent actors working away to make the Bitcoin system run. They mine because selfishness.
That is the nature of “Blockchain.” This is not all as reducible as it might seem. All the questions asked here are difficult. Further, there are so many things that the users of these chains don’t understand. Take, for example, the recent analysis of Monero ( ). This blockchain, whose rhetoric-believing users have touted the science of fungibility built in to the chain because math have transacted in a way that causes a huge portion of the chain’s transactions to be traceable. 64% of transactions have been done with a single mix-in. This tainted set of transactions continues to plague current transactions with broken fungibility. And the fix, according to the analysis, isn’t much better. The fix allows a transaction to be traced to its originator with an accuracy of about 97%.
Interestingly, Bitcoin (and I will just discuss Bitcoin) is a great way to transfer value. It is a spaceless commodity with almost no use outside of its use as a value transfer device - at least not yet. This makes it a great way to move money where the process of moving money is expensive. For legal transactions, this will mean that (unless the person has a terribly bad understanding of their risks) they will need an easy way to liquidate the commodity. No business should expose themselves to the risk of holding Bitcoin unless they are a custodian service. For those that are doing illegal things, holding value in Bitcoin is a great way to store value though it exposes that person to the volatility of the commodity. And to those who would tout the benefits of something like tether for this cause, consider that those who are holding money for doing that which is deemed deviant, are exposed to the possibility of seizure every time their money enters an exchange. Moreover, they must ask themselves if they are more comfortable exposing themselves to the volatility of Bitcoin or the risks of a poorly managed peg.
Money is hard. Bitcoin is hard. What I like about it is that Bitcoin forces many of us to ask “why?” when considering how the current system works. Those who have been fair with their answers, understand things like custodianship is one of the world’s most solved and most difficult problems. How do you hold money? The answer for Bitcoiners has involved all sorts of frustrations. Hold your own Bitcoin might be the mantra of the anarchic arrivals, but it’s not practical for ma and pa. And holding it yourself presents all sorts of other problems. Who here had heard of an “air-gapped machine” before Bitcoin? Who had heard of a private key? Some of you will say you had. I’d venture that most hadn’t. And I think the numbers bear it out. Given the Monero data, it seems pretty clear that individuals do not know how to manage their own private keys. And the proliferation of hardware wallets demonstrates something similar. How much money is on Trezors? How risky might that be? These are hard, if not impossible, to quantify.
So now we enter the era of innovation in “blockchain.” All these ICOs have popped up touting their incredible inventiveness. Most of them are doing things in the blockchain space. Many of them are solving what they deem to be hard problems. But generally, these hard problems are being proposed by people no older than their early twenties. Or, they are proposed by narrow-minded neophytes solving problems in industries they have nothing but a myopic understanding of. Listen to the musicians for example. Tatiana Moroz has a token. Originally it was proposed as a token with little to no actual function. She said she was the first musician to adopt Blockchain stuff. She may have accepted payment in it. But that was nothing more than masturbatory self-importance. There was no liquidity in the market for TatianaCoin. Imogen Heap proposed a blockchain solution to the very difficult problem that musicians have: cutting checks to band members. The revolution is here. Now, instead of a bar owner paying a band (which is a corporation) and that band using modern infrastructures like HR software or the humbler check to pay their mates, Imogen has proposed offloading the burden of payments to the payee. Now the bar owner can easily pay the entire band. All he has to do is take his dollars (which he has lots of), obtain Ethereum (which he has none of), take custody of Ethereum for a time (probably will have to buy a ledger or a Trezor or learn key management), then send it off to a checksum-less smart contract where something happens. Now that the band members have Ethereum, they can easily sell it on an exchange. They can then withdraw it for a fee. And voilla , it will end up in their bank account. This simple process is the proposed solution to what used to be the cumbersome and difficult process of direct deposit. Or, the antiquated practice of handing someone cash. I can only dream of a day when my valet is tipped in Ethereum or Bitcoin rather than taking directly from my hands the disgusting fiat. Imagine the improvements that will be rained down by such efficient applications. Every transaction will take only 12 seconds or a minute or 10 minutes or some variation thereof as we wait for a block time to confirm. The valet will subsequently verify he’s received my tip and thank me for giving him custody of the commodity which he will eventually cash out of to pay for groceries.
And while Lightning Network may cut down on necessity of waiting for blocks to confirm, there is something so idiotic about the process of both cashing in and cashing out of these cryptos that is cringe inducing.
For “Blockchain” the only real businesses that we need are businesses that focus on custodianship of some sort. Custodial services are the fundamental, missing piece of the ecosystem. Institutions have them ( ). Individuals… not so much. Wallets like Armory (which is a bit dead) are necessities. And what’s worse is that as the Blockchain gets more complicated, as Bitcoin becomes harder to understand, we will soon find that these services are both more and more needed as well as more and more absent.
So where does that leave “blockchain?” Blockchain is still as useless as ever. It amazes me that most of the world laughed at the concept of a blockchain only to show up 8 years after its invention decrying naysayers like myself as narrow-minded and ignorant. Those of us who have been here, sitting in the lap of innovation, being laughed at, we are the ones who don’t understand how this works. It’s an interesting turn that I wish I had had the foresight to predict. Obviously, arrogance would have prevented those who avoided this tech early on from admitting why, and Dunning-Krueger would prevent them from understanding how difficult it is to wrap their minds around. Alas, my crystal ball and naivety prevented that prediction. I suppose it will be another 10 years before everyone realizes that the real innovation of products like Ethereum is the redefining of the word “multi-sig” to “smart contract.” Same thing, sexier wrapping. And while people like Pitbull ( ) struggle to figure that out, I suppose I can find solace in the fact that real science is still happening in Bitcoin.
I think that David Hogg’s most recent tweet ( ) asking people to boycott Vanguard and BlackRock presents a great opportunity for education. The idea of boycotting these institutions is laughable, first of all. Vanguard and BlackRock are two of America’s biggest investment institutions. And they aren’t exactly the one’s “investing.” They are managers of money. They invest in the things their customers want to invest in. That’s how banking works.
The fundamental problem here is that a kid with some kind of goal has not realized that there are parts of the world he simply doesn’t understand. That’s to be expected. Hopefully, Mr. Hogg, you read this. I don’t have a lot of interest in criticizing you. But I think that a little lesson in investing could do you some good. Your life will be much improved by the information below. It’s just good, simple, advice. And I proffer it unto you wholly divorced from my feelings about your agenda. In fact, I try to be as a-political as possible.
There is a principle known as the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The principle states that all information in the market is reflected in the price. No one will say this is perfectly true. But most economists will say this is true enough. And for examples, you can look almost anywhere. When news breaks about a stock, within seconds, the price will jump in one or another direction to reflect the new information. This is the problem with insider trading. Insiders get information sooner than the market. This allows them to profit from that information by buying or selling their position. If they’re smart, they will leverage themselves to take advantage of the information the market has not yet “priced in.”
More than that, this little rule also means that you can’t beat the market. No matter what your fat uncle Ben tells you about his day trading and forex class, the data compiled shows that the chance of beating the market is as good as chance. And before you point at Buffet, that’s a different case entirely. I will do a writeup in the future about the difference between you and the Oracle of Omaha.
The thing is, if you invest in your morality or even just stuff you like, you’re going to invest in some of the stupidest stocks ever. Christian teetotalers might completely avoid liquor stocks. Libertarians might avoid banks. Liberals might avoid oil. Palestinians might divest from Israeli corporations. Pilots might only invest in airlines. I know a number of people who sold their companies. They often put a huge, outsized portion of their money into the company that bought them. The problem is investing like this means that you can not profit from people who enjoy your vices or don’t like the things you love. Essentially, their relentlessness in doing the thing you hate will leave you (and everyone who agrees with you) poorer. That’s bad for you. That’s bad for your movement. You will have less money to throw at causes you dislike because you refused to be invested in causes you didn’t like. It’s counter-intuitive, but it’s true. That said, the idea of “investing in” a corporation seems widely misunderstood. You have to realize that…
Companies don’t even know you invested. When you hold Apple stock, no one at Apple’s like, “thanks for the money bruh.” This only happens during an IPO. Even then it’s not public that you are the holder of the shares. During an IPO investors send their liquidity away, exchange it for shares, and the money goes into the company’s coffers (after a hefty amount is taken out by the bank for facilitating the launch).
Publicly traded stocks are a remarkable thing. They were invented back in 1602 when the “Dutch East India” company offered itself for public sale. Consider that stocks allow individuals to profit from a corporation’s dealings without taking on the liability of the company’s stupid decisions. If you own Textron, for example, and they murder a bunch of Sudanese children, the executives and the people responsible are under the gun. You had nothing to do with it. You can even hate them without irony while simultaneously being an owner in them. And even better than that, you will have succeeded in never having given them a penny.
Alas, you say, “but isn’t my purchase of the stock propping up the price?” No! It’s not. Well, I guess the better answer is that this is complicated. But simply, if markets are efficient and prices reflect all available information, your not participating doesn’t really matter. If you aren’t buying or selling, an arbitrageur or a bank or an analyst will eat up your position. That means that you will be the only one missing out when the stock goes up. Or you will be the only one not missing out when the stock goes down. Feel free my son. Unless your a market maker, you have virtually nothing to do with the price of the stock.
The outgrowth of the principle of market efficiency is the now-ubiquitous index fund. The index fund was a theoretical fund proposed as a means of keeping businesses honest. For fund managers, the suggestion was that they could be kept accountable by measuring their earnings against an “index” of stocks held in proportion to their market capitalization. The result of such a fund over the last 100 years would be a rise of 9.9% annually. That may not sound like much. But to put it into perspective (there are people that are 100 years old, after all), $10 invested in an all-market fund 100 years ago would be worth about $125,000 today. And while $10 might have been a lot 100 years ago, it was nowhere near $125,000 today in terms of spending power parity.
Unfortunately, the index fund didn’t exist 100 years ago. Rather, it was invented on December 31, 1975. The creation of the fund was derided as un-American. Wallstreet equated it with communism. The thing is, it has been the most egalitarian investment tool ever invested. Given modern data, given the work of academics like Fama, French, Thaler, and many more, the data seems to show that the index fund is a democratizing investment tool. Sure, Blackrock can pitch people special portfolios of weird real estate. They can claim future returns of exorbitant amounts. But over time, they will not be able to return what the index returns. And that’s science.
For the first time, the index fund allows “the little guy” access to funds that return the same or more than any other person investing in the market. And that’s amazing. You or I or William Gates have the same opportunity to grow our cash as anyone else. In the same way you own the same or better phone that Bill Gates, you can now get the same returns. And all of it is thanks to a man named John “Jack” Bogle. Bogle created the first index fund. And he did it while enduring endless criticism and alienation from an industry that he loved. And today, Mr. Bogle’s company enjoys $4.2 trillion under management. It’s an astounding number to be sure. But what’s more astounding is that in an industry that regularly takes 2 to 3% from those invested monies, Bogle’s company is uniquely structured. It is owned by the people who have money in it - a mutual company.
It’s fiduciary obligation is not to make money but, rather, to save money. It’s investors, the people whose money is managed, take home as much as they can - and that’s how it should be. Investors put money into investments taking all the risks. Why, then, would that investor want the bank, which does nothing more than the transactions, to take 2 to 3%. The investor takes all the risk, the bank gets a huge portion of the reward. That’s why Bogle’s company takes only .05% every year. By the way, if you haven’t figured it out yet, Bogle’s company is known as Vanguard.
So let’s consider Hogg’s claim. Vanguard and BlackRock are two of the biggest investors in gun stocks. Vanguard and BlackRock have outsized portions of their managed monies in index funds (Vanguard has it’s own index funds and BlackRock manages the famed SPDR indices)…
When you have $434 billion and $4.2 trillion under management, much of it in all-market index funds, of course you end up being the thousand pound gorilla. And for those who are angry at the declaration, moving your money out of a low-cost mutual fund at BlackRock or Vanguard will just mean that you move it into another company with the exact same portfolio. You are no less invested in the gun industry or whatever loathsome industry you’re trying to avoid than you were the day before.
Ultimately, it’s important to look at investors like Buffet. He invests differently than you and me. While most of us are passive, he is active. I sit on the periphery of my investments. When Apple does well, I am excited because the portion of my portfolio comprising Apple goes up. When Buffet buys Apple, he ends up owning Apple. He has regularly taken positions in companies, and then actively worked to fix the portion that he saw extra value in. Basically, he does what he can to help the company make more money.
The problem is that when you invest in companies, you do it to make a profit. You’re just like Buffet in that way. And if you do ascribe to the principles of the efficient market, than you will have a weird dilemma on your hands. Advocating your morality will mean advocating that certain companies cease to exist. So I prefer to take the opposite position. Rather than advocating that companies cease to exist at shareholder meetings, you can simultaneously take advantage of the vice by investing, while taking contrarian positions against the company. If your gripes are meritorious, then you will easily whether the downfall of the company or industry. But, if your protests have the opposite affect of driving people to the business or the industry, you simultaneously are able to take the money of people doing the thing you hate. Yes sir, the index fund allows you to drink their milkshake. You can drink it up. Their money is your money because… well… you’re an investor and you get to benefit from the profits of the corporation without having to take a position on the morality of the company’s proceedings.
Yes, friends, the index fund is the only thing that will allow you to both have your cake and also eat it. Because while eating the cake of self-righteous protest, you can ingratiate yourself with the moneys spent by those whom you disagree with. All this while taking no responsibility or culpability in the actions of the nefarious company you hate. And that’s why America is a great country.
And that’s also why Vanguard is a great company. The truth is that Vanguard wiil likely be responsible for more social mobility than any other company in the history of the United states because of, as Bogle says, “ The Relentless Rules of Humble Arithmetic. ( ) ” Citizens in other countries are perplexed by the ability of American’s to freely invest as we do. And our incredible access to investments with unmatched returns is the relentless work of unsung financial academics.
So sure, protest your gun manufacturers. Protest your local politicians. Protest whomever you want and whatever you want. But realize that boycotting Vanguard or BlackRock or any other low-rate index fund management company hurts no one but yourself.
There is a concept of the God of the Gap. The idea of the God of the Gap is that God exists wherever science fails to explain creation. The long-known problem of the notion that God exists in the gaps is that the mystery of a divine is removed every time science explains something new.
Right now, Bitcoin is great for gambling, drug purchasing, exporting value from totalitarian countries (which is a kind of remittance), men hiding money from wives, governments making payments to informants, and any other kind of transaction that requires fungibility, anonymity, and censorship resistance. There are certainly other uses. But these are some of the big ones. Given the risks, for the most part, fiat is a better medium of exchange for most transactions. While Bitcoin is romanticized by Libertarians as the holy grail of money, users have to come to grips with Bitcoin’s volatility. Over the last 30 days, for example, Bitcoin’s volatility is approximately 7.14. This sort of volatility makes Bitcoin terrible for spending. Bitcoin inflates and deflates as much as 50% to 100% over the course of a month. Very simply, holding Bitcoin today can mean that your spending power is reduced by 50% a month from now. It can also mean that your spending power is doubled over the same period. This sort of uncertainty makes it difficult to hold if your only intention is to use it as money. Practically speaking, when a person is holding money, it needs to be known whether they will be able to pay rent the coming month. And while an economy that sees everything denominated in Bitcoin might have significant menu changing costs that would allow that sort of thing to happen, while it’s denominated in fiat, the cost is articulated minute by minute. And I don’t think that’s going to change very soon, considering the volatility metrics. Just consider the turmoil that would exist if the US Dollar did that.
So what is Bitcoin good for? Well, not a lot. We must consider that its uses need to be able to sustain the sorts of losses we spoke of above. And, while I think that Bitcoin’s undervalued still, there is no guarantee that its “hodlers” be compensated for the risk (volatility) of the asset. Some of the uses given above are evergreen. Governments will always need an asset that they can pay informants with. Bitcoin is a wonderful way to do that. It allows payment outside of the financial ecosystem. Simply, while KYC and AML regulations are good for a government’s ability to track money and the people using it, Bitcoin allows nation states to sidestep an enemy’s desire to track money. This would allow the anonymous payment of informants in countries where the risk of delivering pallets of bills would be mind-blowingly dangerous. This is one of the neatest uses of Bitcoin. Consider the ability to pay an informant behind the lines of ISIS. Payment from a foreign government in exchange for good information can be made again and again and again. The informant can continue to inform without fear of compromise. It’s remittance, of an important sort.
Likewise, Bitcoin has the potential to remove the last mile problem for remittance. This is a problem that plagues companies. That said, I’m not entirely certain how much it costs to service that last mile. If you have never heard of the last mile problem, with regard to remittance, it’s the final problem of cash delivery. Abra tried to turn this on its head by making cash delivery mobile. Local Bitcoins has done the same thing for as long as they’ve been around. Essentially, Bitcoin removes the need for currency deliverers. It puts the burden of the last mile onto the recipient of the coins. This means that a recipient can choose to hold the risk of Bitcoin or sell their Bitcoin to a local. Meanwhile, they get to hold the settled value regardless of what they do. Additionally, I suspect that countries with unstable currency, Bitcoin will be a better hold. People with low access to investable markets and currency options that are rotten will likely turn to exchanging Bitcoin. This would lessen the confiscation risk that many suffer under despotic rule.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s got some huge markets to disrupt. Gambling and drugs and other illicit things. So the question remains, how much supply do drugs and gambling eat up. I’m certain that there are answers to that question. But there is a strong chance that over the next 10 to 15 years countries will begin legalizing both activities. In a world where gambling and drugs become legalized, what happens to Bitcoin’s use in those spaces? While Bitcoiners want to sound the fiat currency shofar, signaling its apocolyptic downfall, for transactions on the up-and-up, fiat is hard to beat. And when fiat is not easily sent to someone, credit cards’ 2 to 3% seems to fit the bill pretty well. And even if 2 to 3% is expensive, consider that the credit card companies simply need to reduce their fees to compete with any good transactions that use Bitcoin. And that will happen. I guarantee it.
Gambling is following a similar trajectory. There are very serious talks about legalizing gambling in the US. Verizon is even talking about getting in when it happens. I can’t help but think that this is the result of Bitcoin. While gambling has always been a sort of gray industry, Bitcoin’s made it nearly impossible to regulate. Remittance companies used to be a large bit of the onboarding process to online gambling portals. Regulations squeezed that out of the hands of true remitters like Western Union. And just as regulators thought they had controlled the online gambling problem, Bitcoin came on the scene and ruined everything. But what happens if gambling is legalized? Then the only reason to really use crypto for the purpose of gambling will be tax evasion. And while some people will certainly use bitcoin for that purpose, for many the consequences of doing that will be too damn high (even for a seasoned gambler).
Now I think it’s important not to be myopic in our analysis of Bitcoin. I understand that these examples here are uniquely American. But consider that Bitcoin’s global status sets the demand. Its purchase, for the most part, is unregulated and I’m certain it follows a sort of global vice index for the most part. But I’m left wondering, as vices are made legal or mainstreamed, will Bitcoin find itself a diminishingly useful medium of transaction? In the way that a God of the gap is relegated to the corners of the Universe that are yet unexplored, is Bitcoin relegated to some kind of box, and as some things are brought out of the box, will it find a diminished utility? Is Bitcoin a currency of the gap?----




https://trustwallet.com/blog/top-7-risks-of-staking-crypto

Cryptocurrency staking refers to “locking up” a digital asset to act as a validator in a decentralized crypto network to ensure the integrity, security and continuity of the network. As an incentive for helping to secure the network, stakers (validators) are rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency.
Unlike PoW networks that require miners to contribute computing power to secure the network, PoS crypto networks require users to stake a share (or all) of their holdings in the network’s token to secure the network and keep it running.
This shouldn’t affect your APY if you “HODL” and stake the entire year. However, it will reduce the time that you can re-invest your staking rewards to earn more yield (either by staking or by deploying assets in DeFi protocols).
Running a validator node to stake a cryptocurrency involves technical know-how to ensure that there are no disruptions in the staking process. Nodes need to have 100% uptime to ensure that they maximize staking returns.
What’s more, in case a validator node (mistakenly) misbehaves, you could incur penalties that will affect your overall staking returns. In the worst-case scenario, validators could even have their stake “slashed,” at which point a share of the staked tokens would be lost.
All it takes is downloading the Trust Wallet app, buying the asset you want to stake using a debit or credit card (or on the app’s built-in DEX), and then staking it directly within the app while keeping complete control over your wallet’s private keys.----

The ETHDenver #BUIDLATHON is about bringing diverse creativity around a common purpose. Distributed computing is the future and Colorado is a leading community supporting this emerging technology. Our event empowers participants to shape this new world, while cementing the Rocky mountain region and the State of Colorado as a thriving hub of Ethereum and blockchain innovation.
For the 2022 installation of ETHDenver, we’re going back to basics. 2022 is the Year of the GWEI. The BuffiGwei are the smallest members of the Bufficorn Family, and were integral in defeating Moloch in the battle of Etherea in 1246. If not for their calm and unshakable demeanor, the battle may have been lost.
The lesson is...NEVER underestimate the BuffiGwei. Their unique abilities in channeling a mystical force called “ether” has made them one of the most powerful allies in the Metaverse. And like gas which fuels Ethereum transactions, the BuffiGwei ultimately fuels our community.
ETHDenver is 100% Community funded & is FREE to those who are accepted attend #BUIDL. We don’t believe in creating economic barriers for those we’re trying to include. Your sponsorship helps us keep true to our ethos & create a world-class experience.
ETHDenver is the largest Web3 #BUIDLathon in the world (fka hackathon) for Ethereum and other blockchain protocol enthusiasts, designers and developers. This year’s event features simultaneous virtual and in-person events, kicking off on Friday, February 11th in Denver.
Between February 11th-17th, blockchain companies from around the world will host events in an open source format, inviting all to attend. Then moving into main event weekend, February 17th-20th, three venues come to life featuring talks and workshops by top blockchain influencers and experts, BUIDLathon space to collaborate on projects, art installations, live music, networking events, food, drinks, and more.
The community attending ETHDenver shows up to contribute to the global blockchain ecosystem, whether by #BUIDLing decentralized applications (dApps), contributing to or starting infrastructure level projects, writing designing or info-graphics, or to learn, connect, and get more involved. So bring your inner awesomeness and some friends. We’ll provide mentors, resources, and all of the educational content you can consume.
ETHDenver is 100% community funded, and SporkDAO, the community-owned organization of ETHDenver, is on a mission to #BUIDL Colorado as the destination of choice to build a decentralized future, and will be raising a $5 million fund that will be deployed into the investments of projects that will come out of ETHDenver 2022.
ColoradoJam is a feature track within ETHDenver. In partnership with the State of Colorado and Governor Jared Polis, participants in ColoradoJam are able to compete for prizes within different state agencies to produce technological solutions to pressing problems. Web2 and Web3 projects are welcome to submit for consideration. Winners of each agency "Jam" will be awarded cash prizes as well as a potential opportunity for a pilot program with the State of Colorado.
For the first time ever, we’ll be hosting Two BUIDLathons simultaneously. The in-person software building competition runs from Feb 11th-20th and the virtual competition runs from Feb 11th-Mar 21st, followed by judging and closing ceremony on Mar 25th. We encourage participants in the in-person BUIDLathon to continue building on their projects over the additional month to resubmit in the virtual competition ending on Mar 21st.
Some of the most successful teams we’ve seen consist of a good mix of developer, creative, and minds. This year's ETHDenver core tracks are designed exclusively for the creation of blockchain solutions. The ColoradoJam track accepts both blockchain (web3) and web2 solutions.
The #BUIDL meme was introduced formally to the ETH community at ETHDenver 2018 and has stuck as the community wide rallying cry throughout the world. #BUIDL is the our response to the BTC (Bitcoin) community's #HODL. We think #hodling (holding) cryptocurrencies is important, but we think that #buidling (aka building) is much more important. Without #buidling the decentralized future, #hodling will be just a sport of vanity.
Anyone 18 and over at the time of the event can apply to participate in the #BUIDLathon (see next section if you’re under 18). Applications are based on interest in blockchain technology and demonstrated ability to code, design or otherwise meaningfully contribute to a project. Applications from any corner of the globe will be accepted. PLEASE NOTE that non-technical contributors are highly encouraged to participate (the best teams are well rounded). If you have something you think you can add to the ecosystem – whether it's a knack for crafting white papers to explain dApps, a creative or artistic perspective, or an entrepreneurial vision – we'd welcome your talents and skills on one of the #BUIDLathon teams.

We’ll invite you to join icebreaker sessions leading into ETHDenver where you can propose a project idea or listen as others share their ideas. Teams will indicate what skills they have and what skills they're looking for. You can with a number of teams and join the one that feels like the best fit for you. We'll also hold icebreaker sessions in-person in Denver between Feb 11th-17th if you haven’t found a team by then.
There’s a first time for everything. Both experienced and brand new developers, designers, businesspeople, artists, students, and more are invited to join. Some of the most successful teams include a good mix of skillsets. If you’re interested in learning, even better reason to come. We’ll provide mentors, resources and workshops to help you sharpen your skills and unleash your inner awesomeness. Be eager, coachable and open. You never know what you might be able to create.
If you're excited to get working, we suggest studying the skills you intend to use to create your project, but please do not begin working on your specific project. We believe in a level playing field. As such, pre-existing projects are not allowed if you wish to be considered for prizes. You may, however, build a new feature for an existing project that is unique and standalone. Judges will make the final decision on whether a project will qualify for prize consideration. ETHDenver will begin sharing learning content via livestreams on Jan 11th.
The focus of all speakers and workshops will be on the latest trends in decentralization and all things blockchain – for example, development tools and practices such as ETH2.0, DeFi, DAOs, Solidity, testnets, state channels, tokenomics, and so on. The official schedule will be announced shortly before ETHDenver 2022. Regarding fun stuff, we will provide many activities to help you take effective breaks and reset your brain. There will also be ample opportunities for socializing and connecting with your fellow participants and #BUIDLathon contributors in fun new virtual and in-person spaces. We're experimenting with several VR experiences, minecraft worlds, digital art, and much more. Check out the Schedule for details.
Diversity encompasses the full range of experiential, ethnic, socio-economic backgrounds, countries of origin, sexual preferences, and gender orientations. We are truly a "big umbrella" community, and believe we're far stronger for having a rich variety of backgrounds and diverse intelligences.
The #Bufficorn is a magical fantastical animal that represents the collaborative spirit of ETHDenver. They live in communities atop Colorado's 14'er mountain peaks and strive to serve their communities above their own selfish interests. For more backstory, read the full anthology HERE.
Living amongst the Bufficorn is the Spork Marmot (marmota sporkialus); a wiley and intelligent creature, known for their use of sporks for virtually everything, seeing clearly that it is a most utilitarian and superior utensil. A symbioses formed between the Bufficorn and the Spork Marmot shortly after the War of Protocolis, when the famed Writ of Mt. Sneffels, along with various other 140 character musings, spread widely across the Front Range. The Spork Marmot, fluent in countless languages, was able to relay the wisdom of the Bufficorn by means of the bird Twiterpalious (colloquially known as the “Mountain Bluebird”), which found great dietary benefit in the pink sparkles trailing a herd of Bufficorn.
The #Bufficorn makes quite a unique sound, "BUIDL!". It is solely responsible for the Ethereum community's rally cry. Those who subscribe to the community nature of the #Bufficorn will honor this incredible creature by replicating its call to action!
We suggest reaching out in Discord as many Stewards and mentors are actively monitoring requests. You can also direct requests to hello@ethdenver.com , particularly if they are complex or personal in nature.

The dev conference on anything related to Ethereum, DeFi, NFTs, EVM scaling, Gaming and more with a focus on decentralization and community projects such as Yearn and its ecosystem. Questions? Join our community on Telegram ( )
ETHDubai is the conference for passionate devs and contributors on anything related to *Ethereum, DeFi, NFTs, EVM, Gaming on the EVM and more* with a focus on decentralization and *community projects such as Yearn and its ecosystem*. Expect *great speakers, talks, workshops for both experts and beginners and tons of great social events* you will not forget. Dubai is one of the easiest place on Earth to get to *without a visa and without a vaccine passport (only PCR test)* wherever you are from, with beautiful pristine sand beaches, great weather, affordable accommodation and endless entertainment for all.
Last but not least, if you are a frontend developer that wants to learn web3 but don't know where to start, we will have workshops with experts so that you can get started writing your first dapp with Solidity, Typescript and basic React knowledge. *We will also provide more advanced workshops for people already familiar with web3 technologies*. We will post more details soon so make sure to subscribe to our mailing list for more details ( ).
Yearn is the reference when it comes to yield generation, it offers easy to use saving accounts for regular users in order to earn interests on their currencies. In this workshop, you will learn how to write your own strategy and possibly make passive income thanks to the fees generated.
You are a frontend developer and want to get started with Web3? You have found the right place as the MetaMask team itself will teach you how to level up your frontend skills to build powerful dapps using all the needed web3 tools.
BentoBox 🍱 is a revolutionary technology built by @Boring_Crypto. It is used by both Sushi and MIM Spell and Sarang is a core dev at Sushi working on it. "BentoBox is a token vault that can support a collection of Dapps."
"Users can interact with these many Dapps in a gas-efficient manner, by leveraging the benefits of using a mutual token vault. On the other side of the coin, developers can even take advantage of the power of BentoBox, as it allows for the deployment of contracts at a lower cost, thanks to its gas efficient infrastructure, so developers can focus on what really matters, building.
Writing your Smart Contract is only half the work, you also need a Web3 frontend and a way to query this contract easily. In this workshop, you will learn how to index your contract in order to query it easily in you Web3 app. This allows building powerful Web3 dapp with great UX.
Luis will be explaining how developers can use the Gelato Network and its new suite of tools to outsource their transaction flow to a network of bots executing them reliably. Developers will understand how they can build new types of automated dapps that are not constrained by the limitations and complexities around getting users' transactions sent and mined reliably.
Luis is the founder and legendary member of Gelato Network. He's been active in the Ethereum space since early 2017 and since 2019, Luis has been actively developing and contributing to building the Gelato for all web3 developers and users.
After the release of Proof of Donation for Hermez 1.0, we will explain the new consensus mechanism that the Polygon Hermez team is developing to support permissionless participants and support censorship resistance in the new zkEVM scalability solution that the team is developing.
David is an Engineer and MBA that has over 20 years of experience in the IT industry, having held different engineering and executive positions in telecom operators, consulting firms, and technology providers. Since 2018, he has been leading projects at iden3 and Polygon Hermez. David shapes the project strategy and leads the execution to deliver the products and technologies in Polygon Hermez and Iden3.
An introduction to the Sway programming language and ecosystem -- a Rust-inspired, developer-experience forward ecosystem by Fuel Labs. I will walk through the language and contrast it to Solidity. Then, I will walk through the process of developing a smart contract for Fuel running on Ethereum.
EIP-3074 is a proposed feature addition to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It extends the capabilities of externally owned accounts (EOAs), bringing them closer in features to smart contract wallets. The EIP was first introduced in early 2021 by the Quilt team, and is currently considered for inclusion into the Shanghai hard fork scheduled for the second half of 2022.
I am an Ethereum core developer through my work as a member of the Quilt team. We help with all aspects of core development, ranging from client implementation, over EIP specification and prototyping, to long-term Ethereum research (latest research topic: state expiry).
When interacting with Ethereum today, you're stuck making some hard decisions on whether you want to run your own trusted Ethereum node, or trusting a centralized provider to work on your behalf. Luckily, you can still run your own trusted node with a simple desktop computer or on something as small as a Raspberry Pi 4, but realistically it is not something every Ethereum user will do, especially those that seek to interact with Ethereum on lower-end devices such as mobile phones. So how do provide that trust at scale? How do you verify the data you're getting is true without verifying everything yourself? Light clients are only at its infancy and these problems are actively being solved so we can stop relying on centralized providers for data which may or may not be correct. We must consider the needs of all devices if we wish to be inclusive and have Ethereum be useful to our everyday needs, not just for DeFi trading and NFT collecting.
will discuss griefing factors, a notion introduced by Vitalik Buterin related to sabotage that considers attackers that are willing to "grief", namely lose money themselves in order to harm others. A griefing factor measures the amount of harm that such a grief accomplished compared to its cost. I will analyze examples of griefs in prominent cryptoeconomic systems and present mathematical properties of griefing factors with a focus on the degree to which design choices can be made to reduce the risks of griefs.
The presentation is an attempt to conceptualize the features of communication in the context of digital transformation mediated by distributed ledger technologies, blockchain, and non-fungible tokens in particular. The main hypothesis is that communication now takes place directly, without the mediation of third parties. Furthermore, the presentation assesses the current landscape of the non-fungible tokens technology in creative industries by comparing existing projects.

When tech was about more than bigger screens, exclusive clubhouses, the un-bundling and re-bundling of features? The days when you went out of your way to try the latest thing. Even if it wasn't perfect. Because it wasn't perfect. Because you could see where this was going. Well, have we got news for you.
All over the world, hundreds of thousands of developers, users, hobbyists, creators, artists, and market makers spend their days and nights thinking, building, talking about Ethereum because we are... excited. We're excited by the idea that Ethereum can change things. That Ethereum is a fulcrum we can use to change money, finance, the web, the way software works and the way power is distributed.
This September, we invite you to come learn what all the talk is about. ETHOnline is our way of celebrating an incredible year in Ethereum, bringing the community together at a time when we're kept apart. Join over 1,000 likeminded engineers, designers, and creators to build and learn for 3-weeks. Focus on building a new for the hackathon, learning at the summits and workshops, and gain valuable feedback from ecosystem professionals along the way.
NFTs have taken over the world and creators, influencers, and artists of all kinds are figuring out ways to tie in digital assets into their work. New kinds of communities are being formed too around these ideas, some of which are also adopting the DAO strategy for organizing a group of people.
DAOs are exploding on and off chain. With DAOs allowing anyone to permissionlessly join, learn from the best how to scale these organizations, how to get started joining a DAO, how even to launch a DAO around your protocol, and more.
As they say, a builder is nothing without their tools. In this summit we'll hear from some of the best tools in the ecosystem (and their creators), best practices, and how to get started building the decentalized web.
While Layer 2 is taking off on Ethereum, topics like cross-chain transactions and fast withdrawals are top of mind. At the same time, Ethereum is planning for its largest release to date with the merge with the beacon chain.----
